  "Description": "Requests is a HTTP library. Prior to 2.32.0, when making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.32.0.",
