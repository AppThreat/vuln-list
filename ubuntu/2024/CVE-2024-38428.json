  "Description": "url.c in GNU Wget through 1.24.5 mishandles semicolons in the userinfo subcomponent of a URI, and thus there may be insecure behavior in which data that was supposed to be in the userinfo subcomponent is misinterpreted to be part of the host subcomponent.",

  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e using semicolons in the userinfo component isn't a common",
    "mdeslaur\u003e occurence, but a user could be tricked into thinking they are",
