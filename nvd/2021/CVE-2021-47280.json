      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm: Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique()\n\nThere is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due\nto retrieving file_priv-\u003emaster prior to locking the device's master\nmutex.\n\nAn example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error\nfound by Syzbot:\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803\n\nIn the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is\nbecause another process had acquired the device's master mutex in\ndrm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv-\u003emaster in\ndrm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv-\u003emaster was subsequently\nfreed before the mutex was unlocked.\n\nTo fix this, we lock the device's master mutex before retrieving the\npointer from from fpriv-\u003emaster. This patch passes the Syzbot\nreproducer test."
