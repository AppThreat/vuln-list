      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_work\n\nWhen the ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crashes\nwith null pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove\nfunction tries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using\ncancel_delayed_work_sync routine and unregister switch from dsa.\n\nDuring dsa_unregister_switch it calls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn\nreschedules the workqueue since mib_interval is non-zero.\nDue to which queue executed after mib_interval and it tries to access\ndp-\u003eslave. But the slave is unregistered in the ksz_switch_remove\nfunction. Hence kernel crashes.\n\nTo avoid this crash, before canceling the workqueue, resetted the\nmib_interval to 0.\n\nv1 -\u003e v2:\n-Removed the if condition in ksz_mib_read_work"
