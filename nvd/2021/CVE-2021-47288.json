      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: ngene: Fix out-of-bounds bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf()\n\nFix an 11-year old bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() while\naddressing the following warnings caught with -Warray-bounds:\n\narch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:22:16: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]\narch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]\n\nThe problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes of\ndata into a one-byte size member _config_ of the wrong structue\nFW_CONFIGURE_BUFFERS, in a single call to memcpy(). This causes a\nlegitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the length\nof \u0026com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config. It seems that the right\nstructure is FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains\n6 more members apart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name of\nthe function ngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actual\nintention is to ConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers\n(which takes place in the function ngene_command_config_buf(), above).\n\nFix this by enclosing those 6 members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS\ninto new struct config, and use \u0026com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config as\nthe destination address, instead of \u0026com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config,\nwhen calling memcpy().\n\nThis also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable\n-Warray-bounds and get us closer to being able to tighten the\nFORTIFY_SOURCE routines on memcpy()."
