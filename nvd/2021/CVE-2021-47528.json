      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdnsp: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in cdnsp_endpoint_init()\n\nIn cdnsp_endpoint_init(), cdnsp_ring_alloc() is assigned to pep-\u003ering\nand there is a dereference of it in cdnsp_endpoint_init(), which could\nlead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of cdnsp_ring_alloc().\n\nFix this bug by adding a check of pep-\u003ering.\n\nThis bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs\ndifferential checking to identify inconsistent security operations\n(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the\ninconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or\nthe callers, so they constitute bugs.\n\nNote that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false\npositive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed\nthe bug.\n\nBuilds with CONFIG_USB_CDNSP_GADGET=y show no new warnings,\nand our static analyzer no longer warns about this code."
