      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: batman-adv: fix error handling\n\nSyzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was\nin wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().\n\nBefore this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case\nof any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when\nthere is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are\ninitialized; but there isn't any.\n\nAll written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide\nODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv-\u003enc.work, syzbot was able to hit\nGPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]\n\nTo fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.\nIt is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling\npath 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded\nbatadv_*_free() functions.\n\nSo, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory\nbefore returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()\nand open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching\nuninitialized fields."
