      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix abort logic in btrfs_replace_file_extents\n\nError injection testing uncovered a case where we'd end up with a\ncorrupt file system with a missing extent in the middle of a file.  This\noccurs because the if statement to decide if we should abort is wrong.\n\nThe only way we would abort in this case is if we got a ret !=\n-EOPNOTSUPP and we called from the file clone code.  However the\nprealloc code uses this path too.  Instead we need to abort if there is\nan error, and the only error we _don't_ abort on is -EOPNOTSUPP and only\nif we came from the clone file code."
