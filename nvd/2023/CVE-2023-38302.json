Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in this instance they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. This malicious app reads from the \"ro.boot.wifi_mac\" system property to indirectly obtain the Wi-Fi MAC address and reads the \"ro.boot.bt_mac\" system property to obtain the Bluetooth MAC address."
