The vulnerability was caused through lack of proper user input validation.\n\nThis vulnerability is known as an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack. Attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. In theory, it might be possible to use this to escalate privileges.\n\n"
