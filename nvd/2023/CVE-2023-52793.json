      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsamples/bpf: syscall_tp_user: Fix array out-of-bound access\n\nCommit 06744f24696e (\"samples/bpf: Add openat2() enter/exit tracepoint\nto syscall_tp sample\") added two more eBPF programs to support the\nopenat2() syscall. However, it did not increase the size of the array\nthat holds the corresponding bpf_links. This leads to an out-of-bound\naccess on that array in the bpf_object__for_each_program loop and could\ncorrupt other variables on the stack. On our testing QEMU, it corrupts\nthe map1_fds array and causes the sample to fail:\n\n  # ./syscall_tp\n  prog #0: map ids 4 5\n  verify map:4 val: 5\n  map_lookup failed: Bad file descriptor\n\nDynamically allocate the array based on the number of programs reported\nby libbpf to prevent similar inconsistencies in the future"
