This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DCS-8300LHV2 IP cameras. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the SetHostName ONVIF call. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-21322."
