      "value": "NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Starting in verson 0.202.6 and prior to version 0.202.10, an attacker can upload a html file with malicious content. If user tries to open that file in browser malicious scripts can be executed leading  stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows remote attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the user accessing the vector.

Version 0.202.10 contains a patch for the issue.\n"
