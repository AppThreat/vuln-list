      "value": "The Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.15.2 via deserialization of untrusted input from the vulnerable 'id' parameter in the 'auxin_template_control_importer' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers able to upload a separate PHAR payload as an image file to inject a PHP Object, though the action itself is available to subscribers. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code."
