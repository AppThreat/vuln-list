      "value": "NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System saveNodeLabel Cross-Site Scripting Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System. Minimal user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. \n\nThe specific flaw exists within the saveNodeLabel method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the user. Was ZDI-CAN-21838."
