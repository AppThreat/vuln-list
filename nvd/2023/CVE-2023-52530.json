This normally doesn't happen\nsince it's only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offload\nwhich has its own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, do\nthat by returning an error code and converting that to success on\nthe cfg80211 boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers of\nieee80211_gtk_rekey_add()."
