User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of the sysName OID in SNMP. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-20731."
