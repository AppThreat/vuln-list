      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vmwgfx: Fix possible null pointer derefence with invalid contexts\n\nvmw_context_cotable can return either an error or a null pointer and its\nusage sometimes went unchecked. Subsequent code would then try to access\neither a null pointer or an error value.\n\nThe invalid dereferences were only possible with malformed userspace\napps which never properly initialized the rendering contexts.\n\nCheck the results of vmw_context_cotable to fix the invalid derefs.\n\nThanks:\nziming zhang(@ezrak1e) from Ant Group Light-Year Security Lab\nwho was the first person to discover it.\nNiels De Graef who reported it and helped to track down the poc."
