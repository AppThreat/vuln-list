      "value": "YMS VIS Pro is an information system for veterinary and food administration, veterinarians and farm. Due to a combination of improper method for system credentials generation and weak password policy, passwords can be easily guessed and enumerated through brute force attacks. Successful attacks can lead to unauthorised access and execution of operations based on assigned user permissions. This vulnerability affects VIS Pro in versions \u003c= 3.3.0.6. This vulnerability has been mitigated by changes in authentication mechanisms and implementation of additional authentication layer and strong password policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
