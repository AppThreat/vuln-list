That is to say, even other CPUs will not be blocked by\nspinlock, the current CPU might be stunk with local irq disabled for a\nwhile, which hurts not only nmi watchdog but also softlockup.\n\nChao Gao pointed out that the memory accept could be time costly and\nthere was similar report before. Thus to avoid any softlocup detection\nduring this stage, give the softlockup a flag to skip the timeout check\nat the end of accept_memory(), by invoking touch_softlockup_watchdog()."
