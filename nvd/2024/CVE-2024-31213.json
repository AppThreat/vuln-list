An open redirect was found in the ICMS2 application version 2.16.2 when being redirected after modifying one's own user profile. An attacker could trick a victim into visiting their web application, thinking they are still present on the ICMS2 application. They could then host a website stating \"To update your profile, please enter your password,\" upon which the user may type their password and send it to the attacker. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available."
