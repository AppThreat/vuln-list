      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests\n\nSince we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our\nrequests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return\n -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when\nthe cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an\nartificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued\nto the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback\nwill also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it\nseems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.\n\nCompared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new\ntls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to\nEINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling\npaths. The handling is identical."
