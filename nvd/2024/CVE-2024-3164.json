Users that get site admin but not a system admin, should not have access to the System Maintenance → Tools portlet. This would share database username and password under Log Files and download DB Dump and other dotCMS Content under Tools. Nothing in the System → Maintenance should be displayed for users with site admin role. Only system admins must have access to System Maintenance.\n\nOWASP Top 10 - A01) Broken Access Control\n\nOWASP Top 10 - A04) Insecure Design\n\n"
