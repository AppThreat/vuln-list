  "mitigation": "As per upstream:\nBIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features.\nIn a configuration which uses BIND's default settings, the vulnerable code path is NOT exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options.\nAlthough the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.\nThis vulnerability only affects servers configured to use GSS-TSIG,  most often to sign dynamic updates. If another mechanism can be  used to authenticate updates, the vulnerability can be avoided by choosing not to enable the use of GSS-TSIG features.",

  "details": [
    "BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -\u003e 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -\u003e 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -\u003e 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also release versions 9.17.0 -\u003e 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the SPNEGO implementation used by BIND. This flaw allows a remote attacker to cause the named process to crash or possibly perform remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
