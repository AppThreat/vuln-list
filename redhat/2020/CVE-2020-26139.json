    "An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.",
    "Frames used for authentication and key management between the AP and connected clients.  Some clients may take these redirected frames masquerading as control mechanisms from the AP."
