    "It was found in AMQ Online before 1.5.2 that injecting an invalid field to a user's AddressSpace configuration of the user namespace puts AMQ Online in an inconsistent state, where the AMQ Online components do not operate properly, such as the failure of provisioning and the failure of creating addresses, though this does not impact upon already existing messaging clients or brokers.",
    "A flaw was found in AMQ Online before 1.5.2, where injecting an invalid field to a user's address space configuration of the user namespace puts AMQ Online in an inconsistent state. In this inconsistent state, the AMQ Online components do not operate properly. For example, the failure of provisioning and the failure of creating addresses may occur. However, this issue does not impact already existing messaging clients or brokers."
