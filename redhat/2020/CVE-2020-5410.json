A malicious user, or attacker, can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead to a directory traversal attack.",
    "A flaw was found in spring-cloud-config in versions prior to 2.1.9 and 2.2.3. Applications are allowed to serve arbitrary configuration files through the spring-cloud-config-server module allowing an attacker to send a request using a specially crafted URL to create a directory traversal attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
