  "details": [
    "Cron-utils is a Java library to parse, validate, migrate crons as well as get human readable descriptions for them. In cron-utils before version 9.1.3, a template Injection vulnerability is present. This enables attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Only projects using the @Cron annotation to validate untrusted Cron expressions are affected. This issue was patched in version 9.1.3.",
    "A flaw was found in cron-utils. End applications passing unsanitized user input which is subsequently parsed by the `@Cron` annotation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary expressions using JavaEL which will be implicitly executed by the constraint validator. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
