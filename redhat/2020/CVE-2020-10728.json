  "statement": "By default this vulnerability is not exploitable in un-privileged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform. This is because the system call SETUID and SETGID is blocked by the default seccomp policy.\nIn OpenShift 4.4 the container openshift-enterprise-abp-tools has been removed and hence is not affected by this flaw.",
