    "An ACL bypass flaw was found in Pacemaker. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account on the cluster and in the haclient group to use IPC communication with various daemons to directly perform certain tasks that would be prevented if they had gone through configured ACLs. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
