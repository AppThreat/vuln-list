    "Red Hat CloudForms 4.7 and 5 is affected by CSV Injection flaw, a crafted payload stays dormant till a victim export as CSV and opens the file with Excel. Once the victim opens the file, the formula executes, triggering any number of possible events. While this is strictly not an flaw that affects the application directly, attackers could use the loosely validated parameters to trigger several attack possibilities.",
    "A flaw was found in Orchestration Template of Red Hat CloudForms where a low privilege user could enter crafted CSV formulae. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privilege of currently logged in user of the system causing serious damage to the victimâ€™s system."
