This attack is only feasible when the attacker is local to the machine or in certain cross-VM scenarios where the signature is being generated. Attacks over the network or via the internet are not feasible.\nFirefox and Thunderbird on Red Hat Enterprise Linux are built against the system nss library.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "NSS has shown timing differences when performing DSA signatures, which was exploitable and could eventually leak private keys. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 68.9.0, Firefox \u003c 77, and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.9.",
    "A flaw was found in the DSA signature generation function in nss. During the process of generating a DSA signature, the nonce value 'k' is not padded, exposing the bit length. Combined with other techniques, this can result in the recovery of the DSA private key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
