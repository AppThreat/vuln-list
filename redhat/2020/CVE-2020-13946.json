  "details": [
    "In Apache Cassandra, all versions prior to 2.1.22, 2.2.18, 3.0.22, 3.11.8 and 4.0-beta2, it is possible for a local attacker without access to the Apache Cassandra process or configuration files to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform unauthorised operations. Users should also be aware of CVE-2019-2684, a JRE vulnerability that enables this issue to be exploited remotely.",
    "A flaw was found in cassandra in versions prior to 2.1.22, 2.2.18, 3.0.22, 3.11.8 and 4.0-beta2. A local attacker without access to the Apache Cassandra process or configuration files can manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. A JRE vulnerability (CVE-2019-2684) enables this issue to be exploited remotely. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
