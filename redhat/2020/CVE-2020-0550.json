  "mitigation": "Due to the high level of difficulty of the attack and the performance impact which would be associated with any potential mitigations, there are currently no microcode or software mitigations for this issue, other than the existing L1TF mitigations described above, which protect virtual machines against other virtual machines on the host; and disabling TSX, as described above, which can raise the bar of difficulty of the attack.\nRed Hat doesn't currently have knowledge of any real-world occurrences of this attack, so the risk of attack may be considered low. To further minimize the possibility of attacks related to this and other speculative issues, trusted and untrusted workloads can be isolated on separate systems.",

Unlike the L1TF microarchitectural issue, no additional CVE have been assigned at this time to cover operating systems or vmm/hypervisor specific implementations.\nAs this CVE is a flaw in specific hardware, not the operating system kernel, and operating system mitigations are already applied, Red Hat does not list the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel package as “affected” by this CVE.\nThis does not imply that the flaw can not be exposed on systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux on vulnerable hardware, only that the flaw exists in the hardware implementation and no additional changes are deemed necessary or practical to address this flaw at the software layer. \nExisting mitigations released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux in response to Spectre V1 (https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution), L1TF (https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/L1TF) and MDS (https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/mds) should already provide significant barrier against exploitation of this attack vector and no new mitigation is planned at this time.",

    "Improper data forwarding in some data cache for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. The list of affected products is provided in intel-sa-00330: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00330.html",
    "A flaw was found in the Intel CPU's cache coherency mechanism. A microarchitectural (hardware) implementation issue that could allow an unprivileged local attacker to bypass conventional system security controls to infer on-CPU Level 1 cache contents is present. At this time, this specific flaw is only known to affect Intel-based processors. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
