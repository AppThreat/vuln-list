  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "DCTStream::getChars in DCTStream.cc in Poppler 20.12.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted PDF document. NOTE: later reports indicate that this only affects builds from Poppler git clones in late December 2020, not the 20.12.1 release. In this situation, it should NOT be considered a Poppler vulnerability. However, several third-party Open Source projects directly rely on Poppler git clones made at arbitrary times, and therefore the CVE remains useful to users of those projects",
    "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in poppler. This flaw allows a remote attacker to provide a specially crafted PDF file that, when processed by the 'pdftops' program, leads to a crash or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
