    "A denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET Core application.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.",
    "A flaw was found in ASP.NET Core. Client disconnects were not properly handled in all circumstances. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests that would consume more disk and CPU resources than necessary potentially leading to a denial of service via resource exhaustion. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
