  "statement": "Red Hat CloudForms 5.10 uses vulnerable bubblewrap package, however 5.11 is not vulnerable to this flaw. CloudForms may update bubblewrap in future.\nRed Hat Ansible Tower is not vulnerable, as it uses 0.3.3 bubblewrap package version, only bubblewrap 0.4.0 package version is affected.\nThe version of bubblewrap package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this issue. Although we have the affected code, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 bubblewrap doesn't use the setuid mechanism for privilege escalation, which is the attack vector for this issue, but capabilities instead. Red Hat Enterprise Linux's bubblewrap may be update in the future to a version\nwhich includes the fix.",

  "name": "CVE-2020-5291",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Bubblewrap (bwrap) before version 0.4.1, if installed in setuid mode and the kernel supports unprivileged user namespaces, then the `bwrap --userns2` option can be used to make the setuid process keep running as root while being traceable. This can in turn be used to gain root permissions. Note that this only affects the combination of bubblewrap in setuid mode (which is typically used when unprivileged user namespaces are not supported) and the support of unprivileged user namespaces. Known to be affected are: * Debian testing/unstable, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) * Debian buster-backports, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) * Arch if using `linux-hardened`, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) * Centos 7 flatpak COPR, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) This has been fixed in the 0.4.1 release, and all affected users should update."
