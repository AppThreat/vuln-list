  "statement": "libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based on ECMA-234. The general purpose of this library is to create vector graphics files on POSIX systems which can be imported into OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice. Programs compiled with libEMF, output ECMA-234 graphics files locally which can be then imported into desktop applications. Therefore this use-after-free flaw can only be triggered via maliciously written applications compiled with libEMF.",
