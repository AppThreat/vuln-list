  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Docker Engine before 19.03.11. An attacker in a container, with the CAP_NET_RAW capability, can craft IPv6 router advertisements, and consequently spoof external IPv6 hosts, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service.",
    "A flaw was found in Docker when it creates network bridges that accept IPv6 router advertisements by default. This flaw allows an attacker who can execute code in a container to possibly spoof rogue IPv6 router advertisements to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against the host network or another container."
