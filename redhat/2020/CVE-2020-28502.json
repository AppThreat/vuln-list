  "statement": "While the OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) grafana-container source does have a vulnerable version of the nodejs-xmlhttprequest, it does not bundle or use the library in the released product. Therefore, the container has been marked `not affected`.\nFor the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the grafana-container for OCP 4.5 is already using a non-affected version of xmlhttprequest (v1.8.0). Later versions of the container (4.6+) don't include xmlhttprequest.\nFor Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM), the different components using xmlhttprequest is already using a non-affected version (v1.8.0). Therefore, all supported RHACM versions have been marked `not affected`.\nFor Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 3 and 4 the grafana-container is already using a non-affected version of xmlhttprequest (v1.8.0).",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "This affects the package xmlhttprequest before 1.7.0; all versions of package xmlhttprequest-ssl. Provided requests are sent synchronously (async=False on xhr.open), malicious user input flowing into xhr.send could result in arbitrary code being injected and run.",
    "An arbitrary code injection vulnerability was found in nodejs-xmlhttprequest. For this vulnerability to occur, the connection must be initialized during the function call XMLHttpRequest.open to send requests synchronously using the parameter `async=False`. If the subsequent calls to xhr.send functions are with user-controllable input, this flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. If the xhr.send function is called on the server on behalf of a user, this allows execution on the Node.js server using the privileges of the Node.js process. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
