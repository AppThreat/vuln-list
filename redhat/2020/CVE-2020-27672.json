    "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x allowing x86 guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service, achieve data corruption, or possibly gain privileges by exploiting a race condition that leads to a use-after-free involving 2MiB and 1GiB superpages.",
    "A race condition flaw was found in the Xen code responsible for handling the updating of the hypervisor's own page tables. This flaw allows a malicious guest to cause a denial of service, host data corruption, or potential privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity as well as system availability."
