  "statement": "libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based on ECMA-234. The general purpose of this library is to create vector graphics files on POSIX systems which can be imported into OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice. Programs compiled with libEMF, output ECMA-234 graphics files locally which can be then imported into desktop applications. Therefore this out of bounds memory access flaw can only be triggered via maliciously written applications compiled with libEMF.",
