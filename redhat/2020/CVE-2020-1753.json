    "A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.",
    "A security flaw was found in the Ansible Engine when managing Kubernetes using the k8s connection plugin. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to the kubectl command line instead of using environment variables or an input configuration file, which is safer. This flaw discloses passwords and tokens from the process list, and the no_log directive from the debug module would not be reflected in the underlying command-line tools options, displaying passwords and tokens on stdout and log files."
