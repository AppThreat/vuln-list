  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU through 5.0.0 in the SDHCI device emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA transfer via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the host.",
    "A flaw was found in QEMU. A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the SDHCI device emulation support allowing a guest user or process to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
