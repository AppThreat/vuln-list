  "mitigation": "A mitigation to this flaw would be to no longer use IPV6 on affected hardware until the kernel has been updated or to disable Voice Over IP H.323 module. Existing systems that have h323-conntrack-nat kernel module loaded will need to unload the \"nf_conntrack_h323\" kernel module and blacklist it ( See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for a guide on how to blacklist modules).",
