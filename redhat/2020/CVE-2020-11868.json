  "details": [
    "ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows an off-path attacker to block unauthenticated synchronization via a server mode packet with a spoofed source IP address, because transmissions are rescheduled even when a packet lacks a valid origin timestamp.",
    "A flaw was found in the Network Time Protocol (NTP), where a security issue exists that allows an off-path attacker to prevent the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) from synchronizing with NTP servers not using authentication. A server mode packet with a spoofed source address sent to the client ntpd causes the next transmission to be rescheduled, even if the packet does not have a valid origin timestamp. If the packet is sent to the client frequently enough, it stops polling the server and is unable to synchronize with it."
