The fix will be consumed from core Ansible. But we still ship ansible separately for ceph ubuntu.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform does package the affected code. However, because RHOSP does not use ansible_facts as a subkey directly, the RHOSP impact has been reduced to Moderate and no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x prior to 2.7.17, 2.8.9 and 2.9.6 respectively, when using ansible_facts as a subkey of itself and promoting it to a variable when inject is enabled, overwriting the ansible_facts after the clean. An attacker could take advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts, such as ansible_hosts, users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation or code injection.",

When using ansible_facts as a subkey of itself, and promoting it to a variable when injecting is enabled, overwriting the ansible_facts after the clean, an attacker could take advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts leading to privilege escalation or code injection. The highest threat from this vulnerability are to data integrity and system availability."
