  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in GnuTLS before 3.6.15. A server can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in a TLS 1.3 client if a no_renegotiation alert is sent with unexpected timing, and then an invalid second handshake occurs. The crash happens in the application's error handling path, where the gnutls_deinit function is called after detecting a handshake failure.",
    "A flaw was found in GnuTLS, where the server can trigger the client to run into heap buffer overflow if a no_renegotiation alert is sent in an unexpected timing. This flaw allows the client to crash at the session deinitialization timing. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
