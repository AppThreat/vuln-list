    "gdm3 versions before 3.36.2 or 3.38.2 would start gnome-initial-setup if gdm3 can't contact the accountservice service via dbus in a timely manner; on Ubuntu (and potentially derivatives) this could be be chained with an additional issue that could allow a local user to create a new privileged account.",
    "A vulnerability was found in GDM. If gdm can't contact the AccountService service via DBus in a timely manner it would default to assume there are no existing users and would allow the attacker to create a new user with high privileges."
