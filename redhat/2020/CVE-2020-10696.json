  "statement": "While OpenShift Container Platform does include the vulnerable buildah code, it doesn't make use of the vulnerable function. Podman is also included in OpenShift Container Platform, but it isn't used to perform a build, so it has been given a low impact rating.\nOpenShift Container Platform 3.11 now used podman from the RHEL Extra repository, and not the podman package shipped in the OpenShift 3.11 RPM repository. This issue is fixed in podman in RHEL Extras so we won't fix the podman package shipped in the OpenShift 3.11 RPM repository.",
