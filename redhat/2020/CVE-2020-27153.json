  "mitigation": "This flaw can be mitigated by only connecting the gatttool client to trusted GATT servers/devices. The flaw is in the service discovery which occurs after a Bluetoth Low Energy (BLE) connection has been established to a device. A secondary mitigation for this flaw is to disable bluetooth.  Instructions on disabling bluetooth in Red Hat Enterprise Linux are available at: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931",
