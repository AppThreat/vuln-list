  "details": [
    "Red Hat CloudForms 4.7 and 5 leads to insecure direct object references (IDOR) and functional level access control bypass due to missing privilege check. Therefore, if an attacker knows the right criteria, it is possible to access some sensitive data within the CloudForms.",
    "A flaw was found in Red Hat CloudForms where sensitive data would have been possibly leaked for other existing roles. An attacker with low privilege could make use of EVM-Admin API if certain criteria is met since there was no privilege check on feature."
