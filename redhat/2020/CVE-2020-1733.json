  "mitigation": "This issue can be mitigated by mounting the proc filesystem with hidepid=2 option (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt). This way only the user used by Ansible will be able to perform the attack as users on the system will be able to access only their processes /proc/$PID/ directories.\nAlso note that mounting proc filesystem with hidepid=2 might require re-mounting it on unpatched kernels, due to a kernel bug (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/584054/why-procfs-mount-option-only-working-on-remount), there will be hidepid=3 in the future (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11310217/).",
