    "CNCF Envoy through 1.13.0 TLS inspector bypass. TLS inspector could have been bypassed (not recognized as a TLS client) by a client using only TLS 1.3. Because TLS extensions (SNI, ALPN) were not inspected, those connections might have been matched to a wrong filter chain, possibly bypassing some security restrictions in the process.",
    "An access control bypass vulnerability was found in envoy. An attacker could send specially crafted packets over TLS v1.3 to possibly bypass security restrictions."
