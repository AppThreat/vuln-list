  "statement": "The kubeconfig file on the node is that of the bootstrap certificate. This means that to successfully exploit this vulnerability, the kubeconfig file must be taken and used within the first 24 hours of creation as it is created with a short expiration time. Otherwise, attempting to use the credentials after this time will result in the following:\n`Failed while requesting a signed certificate from the master: cannot create certificate signing request: Unauthorized`\nFurther, if taken, the certificate signing request (CSR) of the joining rogue OpenShift node is not automatically approved by default. The node still needs to be approved through the use of the commands `oc get csr` and `oc adm certificate approve`.",

  "details": [
    "An insecure modification flaw in the /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig file was found in OpenShift. This flaw allows an attacker with access to a running container which mounts /etc/kubernetes or has local access to the node, to copy this kubeconfig file and attempt to add their own node to the OpenShift cluster. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. This flaw affects versions before openshift4/ose-machine-config-operator v4.7.0-202105111858.p0.",
