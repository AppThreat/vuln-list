    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.",
    "A flaw was found in ieee80211_rx_h_defragment in net/mac80211/rx.c in the Linux Kernel's WiFi implementation. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames, and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity."
