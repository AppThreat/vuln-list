  "mitigation": "This flaw can be mitigated by limiting network scanner discovery to a trusted subnet via the \"net\" configuration in the \"/etc/sane.d/epsonds.conf\" configuration file. Also automatic network scanner discovery can be turned off by commenting out the line \"net autodiscovery\" in the same configuration file.",
