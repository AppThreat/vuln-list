  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.13 and 5.x through 5.0.4. Due to improper input validation, it allows a trusted client to perform HTTP Request Smuggling and access services otherwise forbidden by the security controls. This occurs for certain uri_whitespace configuration settings.",
    "A flaw was found in squid. Due to improper validation while parsing the request URI, squid is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling. This issue could allow a trusted client to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack and access services otherwise forbidden by squid. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
