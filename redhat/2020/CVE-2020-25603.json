  "statement": "Systems running all versions of Xen are affected by this flaw. Whether a system is vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen. For all the systems, the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depends on the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen. x86 systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering. Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory access.\nThis flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Extended Life Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle.

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing memory barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Event channels control structures can be accessed lockless as long as the port is considered to be valid. Such a sequence is missing an appropriate memory barrier (e.g., smp_*mb()) to prevent both the compiler and CPU from re-ordering access. A malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded. Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. Whether a system is vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen. For all systems, the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depend on the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code generation options). GCC documentation clearly suggests that re-ordering is possible. Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory access. Please consult your CPU vendor. x86 systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering.",
    "A security flaw was found in Xen. Event channels control structures can be accessed without lock as long as the port is considered to be valid. A malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a denial of service (DoS). An information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
