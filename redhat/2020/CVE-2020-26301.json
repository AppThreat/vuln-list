  "details": [
    "ssh2 is client and server modules written in pure JavaScript for node.js. In ssh2 before version 1.4.0 there is a command injection vulnerability. The issue only exists on Windows. This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This is fixed in version 1.4.0.",
    "A flaw was found in nodejs-ssh2. An OS command injection attack on Windows allows an attacker to perform remote code execution and potentially execute arbitrary code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
