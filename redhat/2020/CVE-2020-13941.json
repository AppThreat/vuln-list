    "Reported in SOLR-14515 (private) and fixed in SOLR-14561 (public), released in Solr version 8.6.0. The Replication handler (https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_6/index-replication.html#http-api-commands-for-the-replicationhandler) allows commands backup, restore and deleteBackup. Each of these take a location parameter, which was not validated, i.e you could read/write to any location the solr user can access.",
    "A flaw was found in Solr. The Replication handler allows commands backup, restore, and delete backup that take non-validated allocation parameters which may result in the exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LMhashes). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
