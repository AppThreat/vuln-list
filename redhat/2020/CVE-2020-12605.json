    "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability was found in Envoy. This flaw allows an attacker to craft many HTTP requests with long field names or URLs to cause the proxy to consume excessive amounts of memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
