  "name": "CVE-2020-8834",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "KVM in the Linux kernel on Power8 processors has a conflicting use of HSTATE_HOST_R1 to store r1 state in kvmppc_hv_entry plus in kvmppc_{save,restore}_tm, leading to a stack corruption. Because of this, an attacker with the ability run code in kernel space of a guest VM can cause the host kernel to panic. There were two commits that, according to the reporter, introduced the vulnerability: f024ee098476 (\"KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate procedures\") 87a11bb6a7f7 (\"KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around XER[SO] bug in fake suspend mode\") The former landed in 4.8, the latter in 4.17. This was fixed without realizing the impact in 4.18 with the following three commits, though it's believed the first is the only strictly necessary commit: 6f597c6b63b6 (\"KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Add guest MSR parameter for kvmppc_save_tm()/kvmppc_restore_tm()\") 7b0e827c6970 (\"KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Factor fake-suspend handling out of kvmppc_save/restore_tm\") 009c872a8bc4 (\"KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Move kvmppc_save_tm/kvmppc_restore_tm to separate file\")",
    "A flaw was found in the way the KVM hypervisor on the Power8 processor stores the r1 register state in the 'HSTATE_HOST_R1' field on the Linux kernel stack. This flaw occurs while handling hypercalls in Transactional Memory (TM) suspend mode in the kvmppc_save_tm and kvmppc_restore_tm routines, leading to host stack corruption. R1 register holds a stack frame address and its corruption leads the kernel into panic state. A guest user can use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service."
