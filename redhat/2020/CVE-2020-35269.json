  "details": [
    "Nagios Core application version 4.2.4 is vulnerable to Site-Wide Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in many functions, like adding – deleting for hosts or servers.",
    "A flaw was found in the Nagios Core application, where it is vulnerable to Site-Wide Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in many functions, such as adding – deleting for hosts or servers. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected version. This flaw allows an attacker to persuade a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well a system availability."
