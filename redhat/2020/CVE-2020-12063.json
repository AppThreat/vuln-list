Both no way to totally resolve the described in CVE problem, because it is how SMTP protocol designed. Means that SMTP protocol allows some SPAM or forging e-mails and no way to prevent it totally, but if configuring Postfix well, then possible to make it more strict (less SPAM and less forging).",

  "name": "CVE-2020-12063",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A certain Postfix 2.10.1-7 package could allow an attacker to send an email from an arbitrary-looking sender via a homoglyph attack, as demonstrated by the similarity of \\xce\\xbf to the 'o' character. This is potentially relevant when the /etc/postfix/sender_login feature is used, because a spoofed outbound message that uses a configured sender address is blocked with a \"Sender address rejected: not logged in\" error message, but a spoofed outbound message that uses a homoglyph of a configured sender address is not blocked. NOTE: some third parties argue that any missed blocking of spoofed outbound messages - except for exact matches to a sender address in the /etc/postfix/sender_login file - is outside the design goals of Postfix and thus cannot be considered a Postfix vulnerability",
    "For some of the Postfix configurations, the remote user can send e-mails pretending to be someone else (or even using non-existing user name with some homoglyph characters). One of the discussed problems that Postfix params \"smtpd_sender_login_maps\" and \"smtpd_sender_restrictions\" looks useless because works only for authorized users and attacker could get round with anonymous sending e-mails to any local user. The described issue should not be considered as security issue, so it is \"DISPUTED\"."
