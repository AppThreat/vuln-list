    "The tok2strbuf() function in tcpdump 4.10.0-PRE-GIT was used by the SOME/IP dissector in an unsafe way.",
    "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was discovered in tcpdump while printing SOME/IP packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted packets that, when printed, can trigger the flaw and crash the application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
