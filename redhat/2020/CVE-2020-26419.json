  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Memory leak in the dissection engine in Wireshark 3.4.0 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file.",
    "A memory leak was discovered in Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. Multiple packet dissectors are potentially affected by this issue. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
