    "In cdev_get of char_dev.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10Android ID: A-153467744",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's filesystem subsystem handled a race condition in the chrdev_open function. This flaw allows a privileged local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service or potentially escalating their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
