  "statement": "In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP), the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable etcd to authenticated users only, therefore the impact of this vulnerability is Low.\nA similar access restriction is in place in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) as etcd is limited to use within the internal API network, which is not accessible to any OpenStack tenants.",

  "details": [
    "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, it is possible to have an entry index greater then the number of entries in the ReadAll method in wal/wal.go. This could cause issues when WAL entries are being read during consensus as an arbitrary etcd consensus participant could go down from a runtime panic when reading the entry.",
    "A flaw was found in etcd, where it is possible to have an entry index greater than the number of entries in the ReadAll method in wal/wal.go. This can cause issues when WAL entries are being read during consensus, as an arbitrary etcd consensus participant can go down from a runtime panic when reading the entry. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
