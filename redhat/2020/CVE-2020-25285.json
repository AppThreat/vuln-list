    "A race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.8 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory, cause a NULL pointer dereference, or possibly have unspecified other impact, aka CID-17743798d812.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels sysctl handling code for hugepages management. When multiple root level processes would write to modify the /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file it could create a race on internal variables leading to a system crash or memory corruption."
