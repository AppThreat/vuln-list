  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c in the Linux kernel before 5.7.7. Injection of malicious ACPI tables via configfs could be used by attackers to bypass lockdown and secure boot restrictions, aka CID-75b0cea7bf30.",
    "A flaw was found in how the ACPI table loading through acpi_configfs was handled when the kernel was locked down. This flaw allows a (root) privileged local user to circumvent the kernel lockdown restrictions. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
