    "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.12 and 5.x before 5.0.3. Due to use of a potentially dangerous function, Squid and the default certificate validation helper are vulnerable to a Denial of Service when opening a TLS connection to an attacker-controlled server for HTTPS. This occurs because unrecognized error values are mapped to NULL, but later code expects that each error value is mapped to a valid error string.",
    "A flaw was found in squid. A denial-of-service attack while processing TLS certificates is possible due to use of a potentially dangerous function in Squid and the default certificate validation helper. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
