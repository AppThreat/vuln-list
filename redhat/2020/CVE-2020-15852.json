  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.5 through 5.7.9, as used in Xen through 4.13.x for x86 PV guests. An attacker may be granted the I/O port permissions of an unrelated task. This occurs because tss_invalidate_io_bitmap mishandling causes a loss of synchronization between the I/O bitmaps of TSS and Xen, aka CID-cadfad870154.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, in the way IOPL and IOPERM system calls were handled during context switches in x86 PV guests. This flaw allows a local guest user to escalate their privileges to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
