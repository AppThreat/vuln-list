    "Node.js \u003c 14.11.0 is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission which can make the server unable to accept new connections.",
    "A flaw was found in Node.js 14.x, in versions before 14.11, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by delayed requests. When used as an edge server, this flaw allows an attacker to initiate a large number of HTTP requests, causing resource exhaustion and leaving the service unable to accept new connections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
