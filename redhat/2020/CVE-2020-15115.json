  "details": [
    "etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force users' passwords with little computational effort.",
    "A flaw was found in etcd, where it does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one. This flaw allows an attacker to guess or brute-force users' passwords with little computational effort. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
