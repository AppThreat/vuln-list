  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "lib/utils.js in mquery before 3.2.3 allows a pollution attack because a special property (e.g., __proto__) can be copied during a merge or clone operation.",
    "A flaw was found in mquery that allows a prototype pollution attack. This flaw allows an attacker to alter the code behavior by modifying the object prototype. A flaw in the lib/utils.js function allows cloning and merging objects without sanitizing their special properties, such as prototype defining \"__proto__\". The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity."
