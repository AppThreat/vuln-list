Thus, applications that use openssl without invoking the `SSL_check_chain()` function are not vulnerable to this flaw.\nLastly, no Red Hat Middleware products ship the affected version of OpenSSL. However, some components, such as Netty and Wildfly, may be configured by customers to use any OpenSSL version. Customers who have configured their setups to use a vulnerable version of OpenSSL are advised to upgrade to the latest unaffected version immediately.",

  "name": "CVE-2020-1967",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the \"signature_algorithms_cert\" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain TLS handshake messages. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to cause a server application compiled with OpenSSL to crash, causing a denial of service. In some cases a malicious server could also cause a client compiled with OpenSSL to crash."
