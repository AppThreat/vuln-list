  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The Kubernetes kube-apiserver in versions v1.6-v1.15, and versions prior to v1.16.13, v1.17.9 and v1.18.6 are vulnerable to an unvalidated redirect on proxied upgrade requests that could allow an attacker to escalate privileges from a node compromise to a full cluster compromise.",
    "A flaw was found in the Kubernetes API server, where it allows an attacker to escalate their privileges from a compromised node. This flaw allows an attacker who can intercept requests on a compromised node, to redirect those requests, along with their credentials, to perform actions on other endpoints that trust those credentials (including other clusters), allowing for escalation of privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability."
