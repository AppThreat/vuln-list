Given this and to perform a stored XSS attack higher privileges are required, the impact has been set to Moderate.",

    "Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Vega in an npm package. In Vega before version 5.17.3 there is an XSS vulnerability in Vega expressions. Through a specially crafted Vega expression, an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript on a victim's machine. This is fixed in version 5.17.3",
