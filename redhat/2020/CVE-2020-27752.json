    "A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum-private.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger a heap buffer overflow. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially lead to an impact to data integrity as well. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.",
    "A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum-private.h. This flaw allows an attacker who submits a crafted file processed by ImageMagick to trigger a heap buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability and also a potential impact on data integrity."
