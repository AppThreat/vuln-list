    "A flaw was found in Jenkins versions 2.244 and prior and in LTS 2.235.1 and prior. The agent name is not escaped on build time trend pages which could lead to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The user must have the Agent/Configure permission for this exploit to function. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
