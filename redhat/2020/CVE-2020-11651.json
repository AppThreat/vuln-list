  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class does not properly validate method calls. This allows a remote user to access some methods without authentication. These methods can be used to retrieve user tokens from the salt master and/or run arbitrary commands on salt minions.",
    "An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Salt, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when processing unauthenticated requests by the ClearFuncs class. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on Salt minions as root."
