  "details": [
    "The Kubelet and kube-proxy components in versions 1.1.0-1.16.10, 1.17.0-1.17.6, and 1.18.0-1.18.3 were found to contain a security issue which allows adjacent hosts to reach TCP and UDP services bound to 127.0.0.1 running on the node or in the node's network namespace. Such a service is generally thought to be reachable only by other processes on the same host, but due to this defeect, could be reachable by other hosts on the same LAN as the node, or by containers running on the same node as the service.",
    "A flaw was found in Kubernetes that allows attackers on adjacent networks to reach services exposed on localhost ports, previously thought to be unreachable. This flaw allows an attacker to gain privileges or access confidential information for any services listening on localhost ports that are not protected by authentication."
