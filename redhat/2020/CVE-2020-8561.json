    "A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control the responses of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration requests are able to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks of the apiserver. If that user can view kube-apiserver logs when the log level is set to 10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in the logs.",

If that user can view kube-apiserver logs when the log level is set to 10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in the logs, potentially revealing sensitive information in its responses."
