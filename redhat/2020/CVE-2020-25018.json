    "Envoy master between 2d69e30 and 3b5acb2 may fail to parse request URL that requires host canonicalization.",
    "A flaw was found in envoy. An attacker can craft an HTTP request, which uses an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) as the host component, resulting in an attempt to convert the host name (from Unicode to ASCII) potentially causing a segfault. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
