  "details": [
    "It was found that cifs-utils' mount.cifs was invoking a shell when requesting the Samba password, which could be used to inject arbitrary commands. An attacker able to invoke mount.cifs with special permission, such as via sudo rules, could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.",
    "A flaw was found in cifs-utils' mount.cifs where it was invoking a shell when requesting the Samba password, which could be used to inject arbitrary commands. This flaw allows an attacker who can invoke mount.cifs with special permission, such as via sudo rules, to escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
