  "details": [
    "The \"Test Connection\" available in v7.x of the Red Hat Single Sign On application console can permit an authorized user to cause SMTP connections to be attempted to arbitrary hosts and ports of the user's choosing, and originating from the RHSSO installation. By observing differences in the timings of these scans, an attacker may glean information about hosts and ports which they do not have access to scan directly.",
    "A flaw was found in Red Hat Single Sign On. A test connection available on the application console can permit an authorized user to cause SMTP connections to be attempted to arbitrary hosts and ports of the user's choosing. By observing differences in the timings of these scans, an attacker may glean information about hosts and ports which they do not have access to scan directly. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
