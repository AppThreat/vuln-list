    "An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.",
    "A flaw was found in ath10k_htt_rx_proc_rx_frag_ind_hl in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt_rx.c in the Linux kernel WiFi implementations, where it accepts a second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and then process them as full unfragmented frames. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity."
