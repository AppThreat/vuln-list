  "details": [
    "Crash in USB HID protocol dissector and possibly other dissectors in Wireshark 3.4.0 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.8 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file.",
    "A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the USB HID dissector of Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would make Wireshark crash resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
