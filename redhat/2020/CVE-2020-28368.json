  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Xen through 4.14.x allows guest OS administrators to obtain sensitive information (such as AES keys from outside the guest) via a side-channel attack on a power/energy monitoring interface, aka a \"Platypus\" attack. NOTE: there is only one logically independent fix: to change the access control for each such interface in Xen.",
    "A flaw was found in Xen where access to power/energy monitoring interfaces was not properly restricted to privileged software. This flaw allows an unprivileged guest administrator to create covert channels and infer the operations or data used by other contexts within the system, such as AES keys or additional sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
