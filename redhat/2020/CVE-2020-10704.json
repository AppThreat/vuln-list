  "mitigation": "By default, Samba 4.10 is run using the \"standard\" process model, which would leave only the CLDAP server affected.  (Later versions use 'prefork').\nThis is controlled by the -M or --model parameter to the samba binary.\nAll Samba versions are impacted if -M prefork or -M single is used. To mitigate this issue for LDAP only, select -M standard (however this will use more memory, may allow resource exhaustion, and will still leave the CLDAP server exposed).",
