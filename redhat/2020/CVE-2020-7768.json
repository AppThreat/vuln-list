  "statement": "This vulnerability is related to the Node.js grpc package (grpc-node and a new version of it @grpc/grpc-js). The OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) delivers the grpc package, but it is the C-based gRPC version that contains source code for gRPC libraries. Therefore it is not affected by this vulnerability.",
