There is a lack of validation of the \"next\" parameter, which would allow someone to supply a malicious URL in Horizon that can cause an automatic redirect to the provided malicious URL.",
    "A flaw was found in python-django-horizon. The \"next\" parameter is not correctly validated allowing a remote attacker to supply a malicious URL in the dashboard that could cause an automatic redirect to the provided malicious site. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
