  "name": "CVE-2020-14001",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The kramdown gem before 2.3.0 for Ruby processes the template option inside Kramdown documents by default, which allows unintended read access (such as template=\"/etc/passwd\") or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such as a string that begins with template=\"string://\u003c%= `). NOTE: kramdown is used in Jekyll, GitLab Pages, GitHub Pages, and Thredded Forum.",
    "A flaw was found in rubygem-kramdown in versions prior to 2.3.0. The template option allows unintended read access or embedded Ruby code execution which is enabled in Kramdown by default. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
