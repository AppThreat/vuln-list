The vulnerable groovy extension methods are not used directly in these components, therefore the impact by this vulnerability is Low.\nAlthough an affected version of groovy is shipped in CodeReady Studio, the vulnerable functionality is not used by default, so the impact of this vulnerability is set to Low.\nRed Hat CodeReady WorkSpaces 2.7.0 does not ship groovy so is not affected by this flaw.",

  "details": [
    "Apache Groovy provides extension methods to aid with creating temporary directories. Prior to this fix, Groovy's implementation of those extension methods was using a now superseded Java JDK method call that is potentially not secure on some operating systems in some contexts. Users not using the extension methods mentioned in the advisory are not affected, but may wish to read the advisory for further details. Versions Affected: 2.0 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13, 3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1. Fixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache Groovy. Groovy makes use of a method for creating temporary directories which is not suitable for security-sensitive contexts and allows for sensitive information leakage. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
