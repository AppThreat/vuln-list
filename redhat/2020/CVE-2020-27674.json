    "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to gain guest OS privileges by modifying kernel memory contents, because invalidation of TLB entries is mishandled during use of an INVLPG-like attack technique.",
    "A flaw was found in the Xen hypercalls with INVLPG-like behavior used by x86 PV guests to invalidate TLB entries. This flaw allows a malicious unprivileged guest user to escalate their privileges to the kernel level within the guest."
