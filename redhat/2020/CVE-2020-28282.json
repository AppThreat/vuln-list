This restricts access to the vulnerable nodejs-getobject library to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is Low. OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) 1.1 is out of support scope for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities, hence is marked Out Of Support Scope.",

  "details": [
    "Prototype pollution vulnerability in 'getobject' version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.",
    "A flaw was found in nodejs-getobject. The `set()` function does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property allowing an attacker to create a non-existent property or allow the manipulation of the property which could lead to a denial of service or a remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
