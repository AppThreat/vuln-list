  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.",
    "A flaw was found in PKI, where the dogtag's pki.client.PKIConnection class disables the python-requests certificate validation. This flaw allows an attacker to intercept a connection between a FreeIPA client and a server, and execute an active Man-in-the-Middle attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
