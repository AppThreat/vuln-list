  "details": [
    "Memory leak in RTPS protocol dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.8 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file.",
    "A memory leak was discovered in the RTPS protocol dissector of Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
