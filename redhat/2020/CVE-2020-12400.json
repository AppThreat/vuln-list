  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 80 and Firefox for Android \u003c 80.",
    "A side-channel flaw was found in NSS, in the way P-384 and P-521 curves are used in the generation of EDSA signatures, leaking partial information about the ECDSA nonce. Given a small number of ECDSA signatures, this information can be used to steal the private key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
