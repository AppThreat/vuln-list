    "An information-disclosure flaw was found in the way that gluster-block before 0.5.1 logs the output from gluster-block CLI operations. This includes recording passwords to the cmd_history.log file which is world-readable. This flaw allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log file. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
