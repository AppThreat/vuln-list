    "A flaw was found in libproxy in versions 0.4 through 0.4.15. A remote HTTP server can trigger an uncontrolled recursion via a response composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character leading to a stack exhaustion. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
