  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "PySAML2 before 5.0.0 does not check that the signature in a SAML document is enveloped and thus signature wrapping is effective, i.e., it is affected by XML Signature Wrapping (XSW). The signature information and the node/object that is signed can be in different places and thus the signature verification will succeed, but the wrong data will be used. This specifically affects the verification of assertion that have been signed.",
    "A verification flaw was found in python-pysaml2, where it did not check that the signature in a SAML document was enveloped, which enabled XML signature wrapping (XSW) attacks.  A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to convince SAML processing to verify the signature and accept malicious data.  This issue specifically affects the verification of signed SAML assertions."
