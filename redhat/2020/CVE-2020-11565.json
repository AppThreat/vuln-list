  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.2. mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c has a stack-based out-of-bounds write because an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa. NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that this is a vulnerability because the issue “is a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already held.”",
    "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the Linux kernel. An empty nodelist in mempolicy.c is mishandled durig mount option parsing leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
