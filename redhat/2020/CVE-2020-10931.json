    "Memcached 1.6.x before 1.6.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted binary protocol header to try_read_command_binary in memcached.c.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in memcached 1.6.0, due to not having a mechanism to verify the length of “extlen” when calling the memcpy function if a large value is assigned to the “extlen” variable. This flaw causes a denial of service and presents a significant risk to system availability."
