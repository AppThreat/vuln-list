  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x allowing x86 HVM and PVH guest OS users to cause a denial of service (data corruption), cause a data leak, or possibly gain privileges because coalescing of per-page IOMMU TLB flushes is mishandled.",
    "A flaw was found to occur in the Xen optimization to coalesce per-page IOMMU TLB flushes. This flaw allows malicious x86 HVM and PVH guests to cause host data corruption and data leaks, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) or potential privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
