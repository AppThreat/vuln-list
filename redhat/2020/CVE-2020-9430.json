    "In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.1, 3.0.0 to 3.0.8, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.14, the WiMax DLMAP dissector could crash. This was addressed in plugins/epan/wimax/msg_dlmap.c by validating a length field.",
    "An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Wireshark when processing WiMax packets. An attacker can trigger the flaw by injecting special packets onto the wire or by convincing a victim user into opening a malformed packet trace file."
