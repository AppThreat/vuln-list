  "statement": "This issue only affects the 'curl' command line utility. Additionally, this is only an issue when using the '-J' (with the '-O' option) and '-i' command line options combined.\nIn most cases, there is nothing to gain for a local attacker here: the curl command line utility is likely running with the same privileges as the user, and thus the user can already overwrite all the files curl could overwrite. However, a local user will have to call curl with the '-J' and '-i' command line options while requesting content from a malicious server, which then opens up an opportunity for the malicious server to overwrite local files.",

  "details": [
    "curl 7.20.0 through 7.70.0 is vulnerable to improper restriction of names for files and other resources that can lead too overwriting a local file when the -J flag is used.",
    "A flaw was found in curl. Overwriting local files is possible when using a certain combination of command line options. Requesting content from a malicious server could lead to overwriting local files with compromised files leading to unknown effects. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to file integrity."
