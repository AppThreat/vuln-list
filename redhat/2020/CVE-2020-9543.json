Attackers may also create resources, such as shared file systems and groups of shares on such share networks.",
    "An access flaw was found in openstack-manila, where the API did not validate the user/project on commands. A malicious user having the UUID of a share-network could view, update, delete, or share resources that did not belong to them. Attackers could also create resources on shared networks (for example, shared file systems or groups of shares)."
