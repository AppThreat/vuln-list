  "statement": "This flaw does not affect the versions of `dpdk` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 or the versions embedded in Red Hat Virtualization or the Fast Datapath `openvswitch` package, as they do not enable generic crypto device library support. This causes the vulnerable code in vhost_crypto.c to not be included.\nThis flaw does not affect Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4 as dpdk (embedded in ceph source rpm) is not built in the packages, therefore the vulnerable code is not available in the resulting RPM and the issue cannot be exploited.",
  "acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Ryan Hall for reporting this issue.",
  "name": "CVE-2020-14378",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An integer underflow in dpdk versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5 in the `move_desc` function can lead to large amounts of CPU cycles being eaten up in a long running loop. An attacker could cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period.",
    "An integer underflow flaw was found in the `move_desc` function that can lead to large amounts of CPU cycles being consumed in a long-running loop. This flaw allows an attacker to cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used, this issue could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
