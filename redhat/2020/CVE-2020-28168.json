Additionally, the console is behind OpenShift OAuth restricting access to authenticated users only and as such has been marked as Low impact. \nThe OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) kiali component also includes the vulnerable axios library. Similar to OCP, kiali does not make use of the proxy function and is behind OpenShift OAuth reducing the impact Low.",
