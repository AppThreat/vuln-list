  "statement": "This issue affects the version of rubygem-puma shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, as it does not prevent HTTP Response splitting via CR in early hints.\nRed Hat CloudForms uses affected RubyGem Puma, however, it is not vulnerable since it does not have custom code enabling early hints, HTTP/2 support or way to return 103 response. A future update may fix affected RubyGem.",

  "name": "CVE-2020-5249",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.3 and 3.12.4, if an application using Puma allows untrusted input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return character to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2020-5247, which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses. This has been fixed in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.",
    "A flaw was discovered in rubygem-puma, where it did not properly forbid untrusted input in an early-hints header. This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to tamper with HTTP headers to insert a carriage return character to end the header and then insert malicious content, allowing an HTTP response splitting, which exposes the risk of attacks such as cross-site scripting."
