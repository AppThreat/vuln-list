  "statement": "While this vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers poses a significant risk to system stability and availability, it is classified as a important severity issue rather than a critical one due to several factors. Firstly, while the vulnerability can lead to denial of service (DoS) attacks by causing resource exhaustion, it does not directly compromise the confidentiality or integrity of data stored or processed by the server. Additionally, the exploit requires the attacker to send specially crafted HTTP requests, which may limit the ease and scope of potential attacks compared to more critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely without specific conditions.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-22019",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Node.js due to a lack of safeguards on chunk extension bytes. The server may read an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, which can allow an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service."
