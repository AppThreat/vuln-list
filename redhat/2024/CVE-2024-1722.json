  "mitigation": "Red Hat Product Security is not aware of a way to completely mitigate this issue. However, the following techniques can be used to help prevent exploitation:\n- Put limits on frequency of account registration, restricting how often an attacker could utilize this attack \n- Restrict new account registration to not allow email addresses in the username field, for example, by not allowing the \"@\" symbol. Note: this cannot prevent attacks against existing users who have registered with an email address.\nIf this vulnerability has been triggered, an administrator has two options to remedy it manually by modifying the second account (of the attacker):\n- Delete the account\n- Change the username",

The follow conditions are required for successful exploitation:\n- The realm is configured to use \"User (Self) registration\"\n- The user registers with a username in email format\n- The attacker discovers a valid email address for an account\nDue to these conditions, the security impact has been rated Low.",
