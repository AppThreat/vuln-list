  "statement": "The CVE-2024-26599 vulnerability in the Linux kernel is assessed as a Moderate severity due to its potential impact on system stability and security. The issue stems from an out-of-bounds access in the of_pwm_single_xlate() function within drivers/pwm/core.c. When args-\u003eargs_count == 2, accessing args-\u003eargs[2] improperly attempts to retrieve data beyond the allocated memory space, leading to memory corruption. While exploitation requires specific conditions and knowledge of system configuration, successful attacks could result in denial of service or unauthorized data exposure.",

    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel due to an out-of-bounds access issue in the of_pwm_single_xlate() function within the drivers/pwm/core.c file. This issue occurs because of incorrect indexing of arguments (args-\u003eargs[2]) when args-\u003eargs_count == 2, leading to potential memory corruption."
