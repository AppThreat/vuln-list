    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests\nSince we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our\nrequests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return\n-EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when\nthe cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an\nartificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued\nto the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback\nwill also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it\nseems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.\nCompared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new\ntls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to\nEINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling\npaths. The handling is identical.",
    "A flaw was found in the tls subsystem of the Linux kernel. When setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on requests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_encrypt and crypto_aead_decrypt functions can return  -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. This issue could lead to undefined behavior and a denial of service condition."
