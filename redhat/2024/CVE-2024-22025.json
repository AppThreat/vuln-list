  "statement": "The identified flaw in Node.js, which involves the fetch() function always decoding Brotli content regardless of its source, represents a moderate severity issue due to its potential to facilitate denial of service attacks through resource exhaustion. This vulnerability allows malicious actors to manipulate the URL parameter passed into fetch(), exploiting the consistent Brotli decoding behavior to overwhelm system memory resources. While the impact is constrained to process termination, its severity is moderated by the requirement for specific conditions, such as untrusted URLs and system configurations.",

    "A vulnerability in Node.js has been identified, allowing for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion when using the fetch() function to retrieve content from an untrusted URL.\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted URL.\nAn attacker controlling the URL passed into fetch() can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust memory, potentially leading to process termination, depending on the system configuration.",
