  "statement": "The off-by-one error discovered in libvirt's udevListInterfacesByStatus() function represents a moderate severity issue due to its potential to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability occurs when the number of interfaces exceeds the length parameter, leading to a segmentation fault when a specially crafted entry is sent to the libvirt daemon. While exploitation requires the attacker to be unprivileged, the ability to crash the libvirt daemon could disrupt virtualization services. However, the impact is mitigated by the fact that it does not directly grant attackers privileged access or enable arbitrary code execution.",

    "An off-by-one error flaw was found in the udevListInterfacesByStatus() function in libvirt when the number of interfaces exceeds the size of the `names` array. This issue can be reproduced by sending specially crafted data to the libvirt daemon, allowing an unprivileged client to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.",
