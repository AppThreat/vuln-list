  "details": [
    "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the elfutils library has been discovered. This vulnerability occurs within the handle_verdef() function in the readelf.c source file. A NULL pointer dereference typically happens when a program attempts to access memory using a pointer that is not pointing anywhere (i.e., it's NULL), leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior."
