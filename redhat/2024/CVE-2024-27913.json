  "statement": "This vulnerability in FRRouting (FRR), specifically within the ospf_te_parse_te function, poses a moderate severity risk due to its potential to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in the ospfd daemon. The issue arises from improper handling of malformed OSPF Link State Advertisement (LSA) packets, resulting in an attempted access to a missing attribute field. This access violation leads to a crash of the ospfd daemon, disrupting OSPF routing functionality within the affected network segment.",

  "details": [
    "ospf_te_parse_te in ospfd/ospf_te.c in FRRouting (FRR) through 9.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (ospfd daemon crash) via a malformed OSPF LSA packet, because of an attempted access to a missing attribute field.",
    "A flaw was found in FRRouting. A missing check for a NULL attribute in the ospf_te_parse_te in ospfd/ospf_te.c file may lead to a crash of the ospfd daemon and a denial of service through a malformed OSPF LSA packet."
