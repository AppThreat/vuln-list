  "details": [
    "Mismatches in interpreting USB authorization policy between GNOME Settings Daemon (GSD) through 46.0 and the Linux kernel's underlying device matching logic allow a physically proximate attacker to access some unintended Linux kernel USB functionality, such as USB device-specific kernel modules and filesystem implementations. NOTE: the GSD supplier indicates that consideration of a mitigation for this within GSD would be in the context of \"a new feature, not a CVE.\"",
    "A flaw was found in gnome-settings-daemon. This vulnerability allows an attacker, via kernel and local access, to access and jeopardize the USB in a Linux environment."
