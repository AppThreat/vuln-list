    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet: tls: fix use-after-free with partial reads and async decrypt\ntls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb,\nso the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger\na use-after-free in process_rx_list when we try to read from the\npartially-read skb.",
    "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the tls subsystem of the Linux kernel. The tls_decrypt_sg() function doesn't take references on the pages from clear_skb, so the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done() releases them and a use-after-free can be triggered in process_rx_list when trying to read from the partially-read skb. This issue could lead to a denial of service condition or code execution."
