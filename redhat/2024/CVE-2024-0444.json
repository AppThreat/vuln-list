  "statement": "Despite the potential for remote code execution, the CVE-2024-0444 vulnerability in GStreamer is classified with a Moderate severity due to the high attack complexity (AC) and the requirement for user interaction (UI). Exploitation of this vulnerability is not straightforward; an attacker must craft a specific AV1-encoded video file and persuade a user to process it with the vulnerable GStreamer implementation. Additionally, the need for precise manipulation of stack-based buffer operations to achieve arbitrary code execution adds further complexity, reducing the likelihood of successful exploitation in real-world scenarios. The requirement for user interaction and the high complexity barrier mitigate the overall risk, hence the Moderate severity rating.",

    "GStreamer AV1 Video Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of tile list data within AV1-encoded video files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22873.",
