    "A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the rust-openssl package, which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.",
