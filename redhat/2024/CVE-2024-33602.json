  "statement": "The identified flaw in the glibc netgroup cache, while significant in its potential to cause memory corruption and crashes, may be categorized as a low severity issue due to several factors. Firstly, the exploitation of this vulnerability requires specific conditions to be met, such as the presence of netgroup-related functionality and the ability to manipulate memory within the target system. Secondly, the impact of the vulnerability is limited to the context of the affected application or system component, rather than posing a system-wide or network-wide threat.\nThis issue affects the nscd RPM package and not the glibc RPM package itself. Affected components are tracked by their RPM source package, in this case, the nscd binary package is built from the glibc source package, hence the affected component is glibc.",

  "details": [
    "nscd: netgroup cache assumes NSS callback uses in-buffer strings\nThe Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) netgroup cache can corrupt memory\nwhen the NSS callback does not store all strings in the provided buffer.\nThe flaw was introduced in glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.\nThis vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.",
    "A flaw was found in the glibc netgroup cache. The buffer-resizing code in addgetnetgrentX assumes that all string pointers point into the supplied buffer. This can potentially lead to memory corruption and cause a crash."
