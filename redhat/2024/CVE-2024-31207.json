  "details": [
    "Vite (French word for \"quick\", pronounced /vit/, like \"veet\") is a frontend build tooling to improve the frontend development experience.`server.fs.deny` does not deny requests for patterns with directories. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 5.2.6, 5.1.7, 5.0.13, 4.5.3, 3.2.10 and 2.9.18.",
    "A flaw was found in the Node.js Vite package. When configuring the \"server.fs.deny\" server option to deny requests that include a pattern with directories such as /foo/**/*, the requests were still being allowed. This can potentially expose files or directories containing sensitive information. Only apps setting a custom \"server.fs.deny\" that includes a pattern with directories, and explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network using --host or server.host config option are affected."
