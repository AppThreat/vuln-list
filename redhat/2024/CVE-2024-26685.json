  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnilfs2: fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_write\nAccording to a syzbot report, end_buffer_async_write(), which handles the\ncompletion of block device writes, may detect abnormal condition of the\nbuffer async_write flag and cause a BUG_ON failure when using nilfs2.\nNilfs2 itself does not use end_buffer_async_write().  But, the async_write\nflag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 (\"nilfs2: fix issue\nwith race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks\") as\na means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the\nresulting crash.\nThis modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree\nnode blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it was\nirrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summary\nand super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.  This\nled to the possibility that the BUG_ON check in end_buffer_async_write\nwould fail as described above, if independent writebacks of the backing\ndevice occurred in parallel.\nThe use of async_write for segment summary buffers has already been\nremoved in a previous change.\nFix this issue by removing the manipulation of the async_write flag for\nthe remaining super root block buffer."
