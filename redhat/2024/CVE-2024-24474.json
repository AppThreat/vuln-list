  "details": [
    "QEMU before 8.2.0 has an integer underflow, and resultant buffer overflow, via a TI command when an expected non-DMA transfer length is less than the length of the available FIFO data. This occurs in esp_do_nodma in hw/scsi/esp.c because of an underflow of async_len.",
    "A flaw was found in the am53c974 SCSI controller emulation of QEMU. When an SCSI layer transfer is incorrectly terminated, it is possible for a TI command to cause an SCSI buffer overflow due to the expected transfer data length being less than the available data in the FIFO. When this occurs, the unsigned async_len variable underflows and becomes a large offset, which writes past the end of the allocated SCSI buffer. This flaw could allow a malicious guest to crash QEMU and cause a denial of service condition."
