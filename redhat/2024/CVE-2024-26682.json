    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nwifi: mac80211: improve CSA/ECSA connection refusal\nAs mentioned in the previous commit, we pretty quickly found\nthat some APs have ECSA elements stuck in their probe response,\nso using that to not attempt to connect while CSA is happening\nwe never connect to such an AP.\nImprove this situation by checking more carefully and ignoring\nthe ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA element\nbeing stuck in the probe response.\nAdditionally, allow connecting to an AP that's switching to a\nchannel it's already using, unless it's using quiet mode. In\nthis case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it's\nactually switching channels, it's better not to try to connect\nin the middle of that."
