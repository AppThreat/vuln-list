  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in jenkins-2-plugins. Multibranch Pipelines with a Bitbucket branch source can be configured to discover pull requests from forks. The trust policy is set to \"Forks in the same account\" by default. In Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 866.vdea_7dcd3008e and earlier, except 848.850.v6a_a_2a_234a_c81, this trust policy allows changes to Jenkinsfiles from users without write access to the project when using Bitbucket Server. This allows attackers that are able to submit pull requests from forks to change the Pipeline behavior. In Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 871.v28d74e8b_4226, the \"Forks in the same account\" trust policy does not extend trust to Jenkinsfiles modified by users without write access to the project."
