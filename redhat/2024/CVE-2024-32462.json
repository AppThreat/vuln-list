  "statement": "This vulnerability poses an important security risk due to its potential for sandbox escape within Flatpak environments. Exploiting this vulnerability allows a malicious Flatpak application to execute arbitrary code outside of its designated sandbox, effectively bypassing the security measures intended to restrict its system access. By manipulating the --command argument and the org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground portal interface, an attacker can craft commands that are misinterpreted as bwrap options, leading to unauthorized execution of commands with elevated privileges. This could result in unauthorized data access, system compromise, and potentially enable further exploitation of the host system.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-32462",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9, 1.12.9, 1.14.6, and 1.15.8, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6.",
    "A flaw was found in Flatpak, a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. Normally, the \"--command\" argument of \"flatpak run\" expects being given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, along with optional arguments. However, it is possible to pass bwrap arguments to \"--command=\" instead, such as \"--bind\". It is possible to pass an arbitrary \"commandline\" to the portal interface \"org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground\" within the Flatpak app. This is normally safe because it can only specify a command that exists inside the sandbox. When a crafted \"commandline\" is converted into a \"--command\" and arguments, the app could achieve the same effect of passing arguments directly to bwrap to achieve sandbox escape."
