  "details": [
    "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9, 1.12.9, 1.14.6, and 1.15.8, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6.",
    "A flaw was found in Flatpak, a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. Normally, the \"--command\" argument of \"flatpak run\" expects being given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, along with optional arguments. However, it is possible to pass bwrap arguments to \"--command=\" instead, such as \"--bind\". It is possible to pass an arbitrary \"commandline\" to the portal interface \"org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground\" within a Flatpak app. This is normally safe because it can only specify a command that exists inside the sandbox. When a crafted \"commandline\" is converted into a \"--command\" and arguments, the app could achieve the same effect of passing arguments directly to bwrap to achieve sandbox escape."
