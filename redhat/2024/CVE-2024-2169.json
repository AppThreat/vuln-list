  "details": [
    "Implementations of UDP application protocol are vulnerable to network loops.   An unauthenticated attacker can use maliciously-crafted packets against a vulnerable implementation that can lead to Denial of Service (DOS) and/or abuse of resources.",
    "A vulnerability was found in certain UPD protcol implementations. This issue may allow an unauthenticated attacker to send maliciously crafted packages leading to a denial of service on the targeted system. An attacker needs to perform the attack on a vulnerable server in order to meet the conditions to create the necessary traffic-loop for a successful attack."
