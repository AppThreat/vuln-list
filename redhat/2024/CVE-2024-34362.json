    "Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. There is a use-after-free in `HttpConnectionManager` (HCM) with `EnvoyQuicServerStream` that can crash Envoy. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request without `FIN`, then a `RESET_STREAM` frame, and then after receiving the response, closing the connection.",
    "A flaw was found in Envoy's QUIC stack. This flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger an abnormal process termination, causing a denial of service."
