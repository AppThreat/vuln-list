  "details": [
    "Jenkins Git server Plugin 114.v068a_c7cc2574 and earlier does not perform a permission check for read access to a Git repository over SSH, allowing attackers with a previously configured SSH public key but lacking Overall/Read permission to access these repositories.",
    "A flaw was found in the Jenkins Git server Plugin, involving inadequate permission validation for reading Git repositories over SSH. Through the manipulation of crafted requests, a malicious actor can attain unauthorized read access to a Git repository over SSH. Subsequently, they could utilize this access to orchestrate additional attacks against the compromised system."
