  "statement": "This vulnerability poses a moderate severity issue primarily due to its potential for widespread impact across various hardware and software vendors, especially those previously affected by Spectre v1. By targeting the Linux kernel and hardware platforms supporting branch speculation, attackers exploit a race condition occurring on transiently executed paths, akin to Spectre v1, to disclose sensitive information. Unlike traditional race conditions, speculative race conditions are prevalent due to the behavior of common synchronization primitives on such paths. Although the vulnerability's exploitation has been demonstrated through a proof-of-concept exploit targeting specific patterns like speculative use-after-free for control-flow hijacking on Linux, its broader applicability underscores its significance. Exploitation follows a threat model resembling Spectre v1 but necessitates the exploitation of additional software features, such as inter-process interrupts and high-precision timers, to synchronize and enable successful attacks.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A Speculative Race Condition (SRC) vulnerability that impacts modern CPU architectures supporting speculative execution (related to Spectre V1) has been disclosed. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose arbitrary data from the CPU using race conditions to access the speculative executable code paths.",
    "A new cache speculation vulnerability, known as Spectre-SRC (Speculative Race Conditions), was found in hw. Spectre-SRC is similar to the Spectre v1 and allows speculative use-after-free. The difference between this issue and Spectre V1 is that this issue is based on synchronization primitives with the possibility to bypass software features such as IPIs and high-precision timers, which may disclose arbitrary data from a privileged component that should not be accessible."
