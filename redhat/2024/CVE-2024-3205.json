Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: The maintainer identified an error in the libyaml fuzzers. It is not possible to reproduce nor exploit the issue.",
    "A flaw was found in the libyaml library. A specially crafted YAML file can cause a heap-based buffer over-read in the yaml_emitter_emit_flow_sequence_item function in the src/emitter.c file, resulting in denial of service in the application linked to the library."
