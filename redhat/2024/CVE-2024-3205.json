    "A vulnerability was found in yaml libyaml up to 0.2.5 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function yaml_emitter_emit_flow_sequence_item of the file /src/libyaml/src/emitter.c. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-259052. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
    "A flaw was found in the libyaml library. A specially crafted YAML file can cause a heap-based buffer over-read in the yaml_emitter_emit_flow_sequence_item function in the src/emitter.c file, resulting in denial of service in the application linked to the library."
