    "Rails is a web-application framework. There is a possible XSS vulnerability when using the translation helpers in Action Controller. Applications using translation methods like translate, or t on a controller, with a key ending in \"_html\", a :default key which contains untrusted user input, and the resulting string is used in a view, may be susceptible to an XSS vulnerability. The vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.3.1 and 7.0.8.1.",
    "A vulnerability was found in actionpack ruby gem. Applications using the `translate` method may be susceptible to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack."
