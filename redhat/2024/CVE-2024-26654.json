  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs\nThe dreamcastcard-\u003etimer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the\nspu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard-\u003etimer.\nWhen the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be\ndeallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker\nthread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly\nregardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and\nthe worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,\nthe UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:\n(Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)\nsnd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |\n...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker\n|    mod_timer()\nflush_work()                   |\ndel_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer\nkfree(dreamcastcard-\u003echannel)  |    schedule_work()\n|  run_spu_dma() //worker\n...                            |    dreamcastcard-\u003echannel-\u003e //USE\nIn order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,\ncall mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement\nPCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop\nop will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the ALSA sh driver of Linux Kernel, when the snd_pcm_substream closes and deallocates aica_channel, which can still be accessed by the spu_dma_work scheduled by dreamcastcard-\u003etimer and del_timer() returns directly, allowing the worker thread to be rescheduled during timer handling potentially leads to an Use-After-Free."
