  "statement": "This vulnerability in FreeRDP, resulting from an integer overflow in certain versions, poses a low severity risk due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, it primarily affects FreeRDP-based clients, while server implementations and proxies remain unaffected. Additionally, the potential for exploitation is limited as it requires interaction with a malicious server, and data extraction over the network is not feasible; the vulnerability pertains solely to image display buffers.",

  "details": [
    "FreeRDP is a set of free and open source remote desktop protocol library and clients. In affected versions an integer overflow in `freerdp_bitmap_planar_context_reset` leads to heap-buffer overflow. This affects FreeRDP based clients. FreeRDP based server implementations and proxy are not affected. A malicious server could prepare a `RDPGFX_RESET_GRAPHICS_PDU` to allocate too small buffers, possibly triggering later out of bound read/write. Data extraction over network is not possible, the buffers are used to display an image. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.5 and 3.2.0. Users are advised to upgrade. there are no know workarounds for this vulnerability.",
    "FreeRDP is a collection of remote desktop protocol library and client software that is both free and open source. An integer overflow within freerdp_bitmap_planar_context_reset results in a heap-buffer overflow. This impacts clients built on FreeRDP. However, server implementations and proxies based on FreeRDP are unaffected. A malevolent server could create a RDPGFX_RESET_GRAPHICS_PDU to allocate buffers that are too small, potentially causing subsequent out-of-bounds reads/writes. It's important to note that data extraction over the network is not feasible; these buffers are utilized solely for displaying images."
