    "A flaw was found in jenkins-2-plugins. In the HTML Publisher Plugin 1.16 through 1.32, fallback for reports created in HTML Publisher Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not properly sanitize input. This can allow attackers with Item/Configure permissions to implement stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and determine whether a path on the Jenkins controller file system exists, without being able to access it."
