  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "HTTP/2 CONTINUATION DoS attack can cause Apache Traffic Server to consume more resources on the server.  Version from 8.0.0 through 8.1.9, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.3 are affected.\nUsers can set a new setting (proxy.config.http2.max_continuation_frames_per_minute) to limit the number of CONTINUATION frames per minute.  ATS does have a fixed amount of memory a request can use and ATS adheres to these limits in previous releases.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to versions 8.1.10 or 9.2.4 which fixes the issue.",
    "A vulnerability was found in how Apache Traffic Server implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There are insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream. This issue could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up compute or memory resources to cause a Denial of Service."
