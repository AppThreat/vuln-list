  "statement": "The SSRF vulnerability in JwtValidator.resolvePublicKey is considered a moderate severity issue due to its potential to allow unauthorized internal network access and exposure of sensitive information, albeit with certain constraints. The vulnerability leverages the absence of URL whitelisting or filtering when resolving the jku header, which can be exploited to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs. While the immediate impact might not directly compromise sensitive data or system integrity, it opens a pathway for attackers to discover and interact with internal services, potentially leading to further exploitation. The exploitation complexity and the need for an attacker to craft a malicious JWT token mitigate the severity to a moderate level, as it requires a certain degree of knowledge and capability to execute effectively.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in` JwtValidator.resolvePublicKey` in JBoss EAP, where the validator checks jku and sends a HTTP request. During this process, no whitelisting or other filtering behavior is performed on the destination URL address, which may result in a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.",
