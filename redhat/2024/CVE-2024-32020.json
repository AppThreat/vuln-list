  "statement": "This vulnerability presents a Low severity issue due to its contextual constraints and limited impact potential. Primarily affecting local Git repository clones where source and target repositories reside on the same disk, the risk arises only when the source repository is owned by a different, potentially untrusted user. This scenario necessitates specific conditions for exploitation, such as shared access to the disk among multiple users. Moreover, the impact is localized to the affected repositories and does not extend to the broader system or network. While the integrity of the target repository may be compromised if the untrusted user modifies linked files, the scope of influence is contained within the repository structure.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-32020",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a \"proper\" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Git. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to place a specialized repository on their target's local system. For performance reasons, Git uses hardlinks when cloning a repository located on the same disk. However, if the repo being cloned is owned by a different user, this can introduce a security risk. At any time in the future, the original repo owner could rewrite the hardlinked files in the cloned user's repo."
