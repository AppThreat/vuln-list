  "statement": "This Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability within the Apache Tomcat package represents an Important severity issue due to its potential to significantly impact system availability and performance. By allowing WebSocket clients to maintain open connections without proper cleanup, the vulnerability facilitates the sustained consumption of server resources. This exploitation results in increased CPU, memory, and network utilization, ultimately leading to server degradation or unresponsiveness. The inability to terminate these lingering connections efficiently exacerbates the severity of the issue, as it enables attackers to exploit limited resources over an extended period, amplifying the impact of the attack.",

  "details": [
    "Denial of Service via incomplete cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. It was possible for WebSocket clients to keep WebSocket connections open leading to increased resource consumption.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M16, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.18, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.85, from 8.5.0 through 8.5.98.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M17, 10.1.19, 9.0.86 or 8.5.99 which fix the issue.",
    "A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability present in the Apache Tomcat package arises from an incomplete cleanup process. Specifically, WebSocket clients can perpetuate WebSocket connections without proper termination, thereby causing a sustained drain on system resources. This vulnerability facilitates the exploitation of Apache Tomcat servers, leading to a scenario where excessive resource consumption occurs due to the prolonged existence of these open WebSocket connections. As a consequence, the server's performance may degrade significantly, resulting in potential service disruption or unresponsiveness."
