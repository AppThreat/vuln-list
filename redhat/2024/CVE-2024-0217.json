  "statement": "The use-after-free flaw in PackageKitd is categorized as a low vulnerability rather than moderate because the conditions required for exploitation are not as immediate or straightforward. While the flaw does pose a security risk by potentially allowing unauthorized memory access, the impact and ease of exploitation are deemed to be lower compared to vulnerabilities labeled as moderate. The low rating suggests that although attention and remediation are necessary, the risk is not as severe or immediately exploitable as higher-rated vulnerabilities.",

  "details": [
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in PackageKitd. In some conditions, the order of cleanup mechanics for a transaction could be impacted. As a result, some memory access could occur on memory regions that were previously freed. Once freed, a memory region can be reused for other allocations and any previously stored data in this memory region is considered lost.",
