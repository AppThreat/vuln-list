    "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel where rx zerocopy feature allowed mapping of pages owned by the filesystem, leading to potential system panic which is caused by the lack of sanity checks to rx zerocopy. A local authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service."
