  "statement": "The flaw in the glibc netgroup cache, while concerning, is categorized as a low severity issue due to several factors. Firstly, the exploitation of this vulnerability requires specific conditions, such as a memory allocation failure within the netgroup cache, which may not occur frequently in typical usage scenarios. Additionally, the impact of such failures is limited to the termination of the affected process, rather than facilitating unauthorized access or data manipulation. Furthermore, the likelihood of successful exploitation and the potential for widespread harm are comparatively low, given the specific nature of the vulnerability and its constrained impact.\nThis issue affects the nscd RPM package and not the glibc RPM package itself. Affected components are tracked by their RPM source package, in this case, the nscd binary package is built from the glibc source package, hence the affected component is glibc.",
