  "statement": "The issue is marked as moderate because it involves a vulnerability in GnuTLS, specifically affecting Cockpit, which utilizes GnuTLS. The vulnerability arises when a certificate chain with distributed trust is rejected during validation using cockpit-certificate-ensure. Although this flaw could potentially be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a denial of service attack on the client, it's important to note that specific server configurations are required for client authentication requests.\nThis is a bug in the GnuTLS library, Cockpit does not copy this code, but uses the shared lib at runtime. Hence, patching gnutls is necessary and sufficient to address this, hance Cockpit is not affected by this issue.",
