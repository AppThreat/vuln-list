  "details": [
    "A DNSBomb flaw was found in the unbound package. The DNSBomb attack works by sending low-rate spoofed queries for a malicious zone to Unbound. By controlling the delay of the malicious authoritative answers, Unbound slowly accumulates pending answers for the spoofed addresses. When the authoritative answers become available to Unbound at the same time, Unbound starts serving all the accumulated queries. This results in large-sized, concentrated response bursts to the spoofed addresses."
