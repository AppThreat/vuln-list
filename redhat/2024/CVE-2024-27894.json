  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in Apache Pulsar's ability to create functions through URL schemes. When retrieving the function implementation contained in the URL, Pulsar fails to limit access to some privileged resources. As a result, this flaw allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information such as secrets, access to remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoints data, and possibly cause a denial of service. This vulnerability also affects Pulsar Broker deployments with the flag \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\"."
