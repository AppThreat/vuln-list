For these reasons, this flaw was rated with a Moderate severity.",

  "details": [
    "Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to an Out-of-bounds Write error when assigning ESI variables, Squid is susceptible to a Memory Corruption error. This error can lead to a Denial of Service attack.",
    "A flaw was found in Squid. An out-of-bounds write can be triggered when an Edge Side Includes (ESI) variable is assigned to a value not in the standard ASCII range, for example, multi-byte characters. This flaw allows a trusted server to crash Squid while processing an ESI response content, resulting in a denial of service."
