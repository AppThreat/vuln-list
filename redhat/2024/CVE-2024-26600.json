  "statement": "CVE-2024-26600 is considered a low severity issue because the vulnerability involves a NULL pointer dereference in the phy-omap-usb2 driver, leading to a kernel crash only under specific conditions where the external PHY lacks the send_srp() implementation. This issue does not allow for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, limiting its impact to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition that affects system stability but not security integrity. The specific hardware and configuration requirements further reduce the likelihood of widespread exploitation, justifying its classification as a low severity vulnerability.",
