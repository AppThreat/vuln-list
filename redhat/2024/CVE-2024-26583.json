    "A race condition vulnerability was found in the tls subsystem of the Linux kernel. The submitting thread, which called recvmsg/sendmsg, may exit as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(), so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. This could lead to a use-after-free issue and a denial of service condition."
