  "statement": "The affected code path can only be reached if dev-\u003eexp.sriov_cap is set. For example, if QEMU is explicitly launched with the hw/nvme SR-IOV emulation enabled (parameter `sriov_max_vfs` is set). The emulation is exclusively used to emulate NVMe devices with SR-IOV capabilities for host software development purposes. Thus, the security impact of this CVE is Low.\nThe `qemu-kvm` versions, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and RHEL Advanced Virtualization, are not affected by this flaw as they did not include support for NVMe emulation.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-26328",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in QEMU 7.1.0 through 8.2.1. register_vfs in hw/pci/pcie_sriov.c does not set NumVFs to PCI_SRIOV_TOTAL_VF, and thus interaction with hw/nvme/ctrl.c is mishandled.",
    "A flaw was found in the NVMe emulation support of QEMU. The register_vfs() function in hw/pci/pcie_sriov.c does not set NumVFs to PCI_SRIOV_TOTAL_VF, causing the interaction with hw/nvme/ctrl.c to be mishandled. This issue could lead to out-of-bounds memory access in hw/nvme. This flaw allows a malicious guest to crash QEMU and cause a denial of service condition."
