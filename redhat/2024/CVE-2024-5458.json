  "statement": "This flaw in PHP's filter_var function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL constitutes a moderate severity issue because, while it allows URLs with invalid user information to be treated as valid, it does not directly facilitate immediate security breaches or exploits on its own. The impact is limited to cases where applications rely solely on this function for URL validation without additional checks, potentially leading to improper handling of user credentials. However, the flaw does not compromise the overall integrity of the PHP interpreter, nor does it inherently lead to data corruption or system crashes. Its exploitation requires specific conditions and contexts, making it less critical than high-severity vulnerabilities that enable direct remote code execution or privilege escalation.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-5458",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, due to a code logic error, filtering functions such as filter_var when validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) for certain types of URLs the function will result in invalid user information (username + password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information. This may lead to the downstream code accepting invalid URLs as valid and parsing them incorrectly.",
    "A flaw was found in PHP. An early return in the filter_var (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) function results in invalid user information (username + password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information. This issue impacts users who expect only completely valid URLs to be returned by filter_var (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL). As this function is used to validate user-supplied strings, this issue exposes raw user input often."
