  "statement": "This stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in nscd presents a important severity issue due to its potential to be exploited by malicious actors to execute arbitrary code or cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. By carefully crafting input data, an attacker could manipulate the program's control flow, leading to unintended behavior such as executing arbitrary commands, escalating privileges, or crashing the application. Since the overflow occurs in a critical system component responsible for caching name service data, exploitation could have far-reaching consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive information or disruption of essential services.\nThis issue affects the nscd RPM package and not the glibc RPM package itself. Affected components are tracked by their RPM source package, in this case, the nscd binary package is built from the glibc source package, hence the affected component is glibc.",
