For these reasons, this flaw has been rated with a Moderate severity.\nThe nginx package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 9 and RHSCL is not affected by this vulnerability because the support for HTTP/3 is not enabled and the vulnerable code was introduced in a later version of nginx.",

    "When NGINX Plus or NGINX OSS are configured to use the HTTP/3 QUIC module and the network infrastructure supports a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 4096 or greater without fragmentation, undisclosed QUIC packets can cause NGINX worker processes to leak previously freed memory.",
    "A flaw was found in the nginx HTTP/3 implementation. If the network infrastructure supports a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 4096 or greater without fragmentation, undisclosed QUIC packets can trigger a use-after-free condition, causing worker processes to leak previously freed memory."
