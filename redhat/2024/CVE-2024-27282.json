  "statement": "The CVE-2024-27282 vulnerability in Ruby is classified as a Moderate severity issue due to its potential to expose arbitrary heap data relative to the start of the text through the Ruby regex compiler. While the vulnerability allows the extraction of pointers and sensitive strings from memory, its exploitation requires attacker-supplied data to be provided to the regex compiler. This means that an attacker would need to craft specific input to exploit the issue, limiting the ease of exploitation compared to vulnerabilities that might be remotely exploitable without user interaction.",

    "An issue was discovered in Ruby 3.x through 3.3.0. If attacker-supplied data is provided to the Ruby regex compiler, it is possible to extract arbitrary heap data relative to the start of the text, including pointers and sensitive strings.
