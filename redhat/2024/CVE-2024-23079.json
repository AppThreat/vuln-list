  "statement": "The identified vulnerability in JGraphT Core, involving ArrayUtil and ToleranceDoubleComparator methods, represents a moderate severity issue due to its potential impact on application stability and security. While not directly leading to remote code execution or data breaches, the vulnerability exposes the application to denial of service attacks and unexpected crashes. By allowing an attacker to manipulate parameters to trigger an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, the flaw can disrupt normal application operation, hindering service availability. Moreover, the absence of proper bounds checking in array accesses presents a risk of information leakage or corruption, depending on the application context. Though it does not pose an immediate threat to sensitive data, its exploitation can still cause significant disruptions and compromise the reliability of the affected system.",

  "details": [
    "JGraphT Core v1.5.2 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.jgrapht.alg.util.ToleranceDoubleComparator::compare(Double, Double). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.",
    "A null pointer exception vulnerability was found in JGraphT Core. In the ArrayUtil and ToleranceDoubleComparator methods, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if the value of the parameter to is greater than the length of the array arr."
