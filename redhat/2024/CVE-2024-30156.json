    "Varnish Cache before 7.3.2 and 7.4.x before 7.4.3 (and before 6.0.13 LTS), and Varnish Enterprise 6 before 6.0.12r6, allows credits exhaustion for an HTTP/2 connection control flow window, aka a Broke Window Attack.",
    "A flaw was found in the Varnish cache server, with HTTP/2 support enabled, that may allow a Denial of Service type of attack. A malicious actor can cause the server to run out of credits during the HTTP/2 connection control flow. As a consequence, the server will stop to properly process the active HTTP streams, retaining the already allocated resources, leading to resource starvation."
