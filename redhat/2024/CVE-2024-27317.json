    "A path traversal vulnerability was found in Apache Pulsar. Pulsar allows authenticated users to upload functions to be run by the Pulsar Function Workers, these codes are in the format of a ZIP file. When extracting the uploaded ZIP file Pulsar fails to properly validate the file names contained in the uploaded ZIP file. This flaw allows an attacker to create or modify files outside of the intended directory, possibly influencing the system's behavior. Pulsar Broker is also vulnerable to this flaw when configured with \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\"."
