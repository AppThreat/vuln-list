  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as an Important severity rather than Critical due to several factors. While it allows unprivileged users to inject code and potentially escalate privileges in a process running with elevated privileges, it does so under specific conditions and limitations. The vulnerability only affects Linux systems where Node.js is running with elevated privileges, and it relies on a specific bug in handling environment variables set by unprivileged users. Additionally, the impact is constrained to the Node.js environment and does not directly compromise the underlying operating system.",

  "details": [
    "On Linux, Node.js ignores certain environment variables if those may have been set by an unprivileged user while the process is running with elevated privileges with the only exception of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE.\nDue to a bug in the implementation of this exception, Node.js incorrectly applies this exception even when certain other capabilities have been set.\nThis allows unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the process's elevated privileges.",
