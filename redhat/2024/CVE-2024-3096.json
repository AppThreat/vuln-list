  "statement": "The identified issue with password_verify treating a null byte (\\x00) at the beginning of a stored hash as the end of the string, leading to incorrect verification of a blank password, is categorized as low severity due to its narrow exploitability and specific conditions required for successful exploitation. The presence of a null byte in the password is uncommon and unlikely to occur under normal user input or system-generated password scenarios. Additionally, modern web applications typically employ input validation and strict password policies that would prevent the creation of passwords with null byte prefixes.",

    "In PHP  version 8.1.* before 8.1.28, 8.2.* before 8.2.18, 8.3.* before 8.3.5, if a password stored with password_hash() starts with a null byte (\\x00), testing a blank string as the password via password_verify() will incorrectly return true.",
    "A null byte interaction error vulnerability was found in PHP. If a password stored with password_hash starts with a null byte (\\x00), testing a blank string as the password via password_verify will incorrectly return true. If a user can create a password with a leading null byte (unlikely, but syntactically valid), an attacker could trivially compromise the victim's account by attempting to sign in with a blank string."
