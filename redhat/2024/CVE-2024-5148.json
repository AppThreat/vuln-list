  "statement": "The severity of this issue is considered moderate rather than important because exploitation requires local access to the system by a malicious user. This limits the attack surface primarily to environments with multiple users sharing the same system. Additionally, the attack vector involves a specific transition phase (from the login screen to the user session) and relies on inadequate validation of session agents using D-Bus methods, which, while significant, does not directly compromise the system's overall security infrastructure. As such, the potential for exploitation is constrained by the necessity for local access and the specific conditions required to exploit the flaw, thereby mitigating its overall impact compared to vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely or without user interaction.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-5148",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the gnome-remote-desktop package. The gnome-remote-desktop system daemon performs inadequate validation of session agents using D-Bus methods related to transitioning a client connection from the login screen to the user session. As a result, the system RDP TLS certificate and key can be exposed to unauthorized users. This flaw allows a malicious user on the system to take control of the RDP client connection during the login screen-to-user session transition."
