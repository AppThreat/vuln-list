  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as low severity. This is a result of a lack of proper validation in OpenSSL's handling of PKCS12 files. This vulnerability results in a potential Denial of Service scenario wherein maliciously crafted PKCS12 files may cause OpenSSL to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. However, the impact of this issue is reduced by the fact that exploitation requires processing PKCS12 files from untrusted sources using specific OpenSSL APIs, such as PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes(), and PKCS12_newpass(). Furthermore, while a similar issue was addressed in SMIME_write_PKCS7(), its relevance is diminished as it pertains to writing data rather than parsing, hence not considered security significant. The risk of this vulnerability is limited as Red Hat offerings do not utilize images from untrusted sources by default.",

  "details": [
    "Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL\nto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack\nImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted\nsources might terminate abruptly.\nA file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an\nuntrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",
    "A flaw was found in OpenSSL. The optional ContentInfo fields can be set to null, even if the \"type\" is a valid value, which can lead to a null dereference error that may cause a denial of service."
