  "statement": "The vulnerability present in Unbound, while posing a risk of denial of service, is assessed as having a moderate severity level from a technical perspective. The severity is primarily attributed to the potential for exploitation under specific conditions, namely when the 'ede: yes' option is enabled, which is not the default configuration. Additionally, the vulnerability manifests in a limited scenario where responses containing Extended DNS Error (EDE) records exceed the client's buffer size. While the issue can result in an infinite loop and consequent denial of service, its impact is constrained to situations where these specific conditions align.",
