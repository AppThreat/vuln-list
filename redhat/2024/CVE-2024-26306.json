  "statement": "The timing-based side-channel flaw in iperf3's handling of the --rsa-private-key-path option represents a moderate severity issue due to its potential impact on the confidentiality and integrity of user authentication. While the vulnerability allows for the exploitation of timing discrepancies to potentially deduce information about the private key, it requires specific conditions to be met for successful exploitation. Additionally, the attack vector is limited to instances where the server is configured with the --rsa-private-key-path option and actively engaged in user authentication. While the risk is significant for servers using this configuration, the broader impact is mitigated by these constraints.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "iPerf3 before 3.17, when used with OpenSSL before 3.2.0 as a server with RSA authentication, allows a timing side channel in RSA decryption operations. This side channel could be sufficient for an attacker to recover credential plaintext. It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption, as described in \"Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack\" by Hubert Kario.",
    "A timing-based side-channel flaw was found in iperf3. If the iperf3 server is running with the --rsa-private-key-path option, the user authentication API can be attacked."
