An out-of-bounds access in the copy_from_lzss_window_to_unp function in the libarchive/archive_read_support_format_rar.c file can be triggered due to an integer overflow when a specially crafted RAR archive is processed, causing a crash to the application linked to the library and resulting in a denial of service."
