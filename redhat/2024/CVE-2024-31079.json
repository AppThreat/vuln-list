This attack requires that a request be specifically timed during the connection draining process, which the attacker has no visibility and limited influence over.",
    "A flaw was found in the nginx HTTP/3 implementation. Undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, causing worker processes to crash and lead to a denial of service."
