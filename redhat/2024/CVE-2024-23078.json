  "statement": "The Null Pointer Exception in the ToleranceDoubleComparator::compare method of the JGraphT Core library is classified as a moderate severity issue due to its potential to disrupt application stability under certain conditions. This flaw can cause runtime exceptions when null values are encountered during the comparison process, leading to abrupt termination of algorithms that rely on this comparator. While it does not pose a security risk or lead to data corruption, it affects the reliability and robustness of graph-related operations, especially in environments where null inputs might be prevalent.",

  "details": [
    "JGraphT Core v1.5.2 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the component org.jgrapht.alg.util.ToleranceDoubleComparator::compare(Double, Double). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.",
