  "statement": "In the file ndr.c, a struct named b is defined, and its address is passed to the function k5_buf_init_dynamic. Inside this function, b is referred to as buf, and the malloc function is used to allocate dynamic memory for buf-\u003edata. After k5_buf_init_dynamic completes and returns, if an if statement evaluates to true, the program returns. During this process, the memory allocated to b is not freed, leading to a memory leak defect.",
