    "The etcd package distributed with the Red Hat OpenStack platform has an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-41723. This issue occurs because the etcd package in the Red Hat OpenStack platform is using http://golang.org/x/net/http2 instead of the one provided by Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions, meaning it should be updated at compile time instead."
