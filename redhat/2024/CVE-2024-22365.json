  "details": [
    "linux-pam (aka Linux PAM) before 1.6.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (blocked login process) via mkfifo because the openat call (for protect_dir) lacks O_DIRECTORY.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Linux PAM. An unprivileged user that is not yet in a corresponding mount namespace with ~/tmp mounted as a polyinstantiated dir can place a FIFO there, and a subsequent attempt to login as this user with `pam_namespace` configured will cause the `openat()` in `protect_dir()` to block the attempt, causing a local denial of service."
