  "details": [
    "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js. Undici cleared Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers for `fetch()`, but did not clear them for `undici.request()`. This vulnerability was patched in version(s) 5.28.4 and 6.11.1.",
    "A flaw was found in the nodejs-undici package. Proxy-Authorization headers are not cleared on cross-origin redirects, which can allow for the exposure of sensitive data or allow an attacker to capture the persistent proxy-authentication header."
