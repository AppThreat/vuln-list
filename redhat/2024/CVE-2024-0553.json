This arises from differing response times to malformed ciphertexts compared to correctly padded ones. The issue is further highlighted by its association with CVE-2024-0553, which is marked as an incomplete resolution for a previously identified vulnerability, CVE-2023-5981, indicating a potential persistence or recurrence of the problem.",

  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in GnuTLS. The response times to malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ from the response times of ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This issue may allow a remote attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack in the RSA-PSK key exchange, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data. CVE-2024-0553 is designated as an incomplete resolution for CVE-2023-5981."
