  "statement": "Current investigation indicates that the packages are only present in Fedora 41 and Fedora Rawhide within the Red Hat community ecosystem. \nNo versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) are affected.\nThe malicious injection present in the xz versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 libraries is only included in the tarball download package. The Git distribution lacks the M4 macro that triggers the build of the malicious code. The second-stage artifacts are present in the Git repository for the injection during the build time, in case the malicious M4 macro is present. Without the merge into the build, the 2nd-stage file is innocuous.\nIn the finderâ€™s demonstration, it was found that it interfered with the OpenSSH daemon. While OpenSSH is not directly linked to the liblzma library, it does communicate with systemd in such a way that exposes it to the malware due to systemd linking to liblzma.",

  "name": "CVE-2024-3094",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version 5.6.0. \nThrough a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.",
