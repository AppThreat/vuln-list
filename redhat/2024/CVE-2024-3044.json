  "statement": "CVE-2024-3044 poses a Moderate severity risk due to its potential to enable unauthorized script execution within LibreOffice documents. While the vulnerability allows for the execution of untrusted scripts upon clicking graphics, it requires user interaction to initiate. Furthermore, the impact is constrained by the user's explicit macro execution permissions, determined at document load time. Although the flaw could lead to unintended script execution, its impact is mitigated by the necessity for user interaction and the reliance on explicit macro permissions.",
