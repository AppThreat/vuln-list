  "details": [
    "Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. Envoy exposed an out-of-memory (OOM) vector from the mirror response, since async HTTP client will buffer the response with an unbounded buffer.",
    "A flaw was found in Envoy's ext_proc and ext_authz functions. This flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger excessive memory consumption, causing a denial of service."
