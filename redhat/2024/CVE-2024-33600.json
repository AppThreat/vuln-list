  "statement": "The flaw identified in the glibc netgroup cache constitutes a moderate severity issue due to its potential to trigger null pointer dereferences, leading to program crashes or exits. While null pointer dereferences can cause disruptions to system operations and possibly result in denial-of-service conditions, their impact is limited primarily to the affected process or application instance. However, the risk of exploitation may vary depending on the context of system usage. Systems that heavily rely on netgroup functionality may be more susceptible to exploitation, particularly if malicious actors can manipulate network traffic to trigger the vulnerability.\nThis issue affects the nscd RPM package and not the glibc RPM package itself. Affected components are tracked by their RPM source package, in this case, the nscd binary package is built from the glibc source package, hence the affected component is glibc.",

    "nscd: Null pointer crashes after notfound response\nIf the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) cache fails to add a not-found\nnetgroup response to the cache, the client request can result in a null\npointer dereference.  This flaw was introduced in glibc 2.15 when the\ncache was added to nscd.\nThis vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.",
    "A flaw was found in the glibc netgroup cache. After a failed cache insertion, addgetnetgrentX tries to send the non-existing response after the not-found header. This can lead to a null pointer dereference that causes a crash or exit."
