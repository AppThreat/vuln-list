  "details": [
    "Incorrect Authorization issue exists in the API key based security model for Remote Cluster Security, which is currently in Beta, in Elasticsearch 8.10.0 and before 8.13.0. This allows aÂ malicious user with a valid API key for a remote cluster configured to use the new Remote Cluster Security to read arbitrary documents from any index on the remote cluster, and only if they use the Elasticsearch custom transport protocol to issue requests with the target index ID, the shard ID and the document ID. None of Elasticsearch REST API endpoints are affected by this issue.",
    "An incorrect authorization flaw was found in the API key based security model for Remote Cluster Security in the elasticsearch package. A malicious user with a valid API key can leverage this issue to gain access to read any documents from any index in the remote cluster, exposing possible sensitive information and having a high impact on data confidentiality. Exploitation of this flaw is only possible if the elasticsearch cluster custom transport protocol is configured to issue requests with the target index ID, the shared ID, and the document ID. This issue doesn't affect elasticsearch REST API endpoints."
