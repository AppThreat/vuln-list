  "statement": "The vulnerability in PHP, where an insecure cookie is misinterpreted as a __Host- or __Secure- cookie due to the incomplete fix for CVE-2022-31629, poses a moderate severity risk. While it allows attackers to set cookies with misleading prefixes, bypassing some cookie security measures, it does not directly enable remote code execution or escalate privileges. However, it can facilitate session hijacking or unauthorized access to certain web applications, potentially compromising user data or functionality. Additionally, its impact is limited to PHP applications that rely on cookie prefixes for security, which reduces its overall severity compared to more important vulnerabilities.",
