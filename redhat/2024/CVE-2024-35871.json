    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nriscv: process: Fix kernel gp leakage\nchildregs represents the registers which are active for the new thread\nin user context. For a kernel thread, childregs-\u003egp is never used since\nthe kernel gp is not touched by switch_to. For a user mode helper, the\ngp value can be observed in user space after execve or possibly by other\nmeans.\n[From the email thread]\nThe /* Kernel thread */ comment is somewhat inaccurate in that it is also used\nfor user_mode_helper threads, which exec a user process, e.g. /sbin/init or\nwhen /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is a pipe. Such threads do not have\nPF_KTHREAD set and are valid targets for ptrace etc. even before they exec.\nchildregs is the *user* context during syscall execution and it is observable\nfrom userspace in at least five ways:\n1. kernel_execve does not currently clear integer registers, so the starting\nregister state for PID 1 and other user processes started by the kernel has\nsp = user stack, gp = kernel __global_pointer$, all other integer registers\nzeroed by the memset in the patch comment.\nThis is a bug in its own right, but I'm unwilling to bet that it is the only\nway to exploit the issue addressed by this patch.\n2. ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET): you can PTRACE_ATTACH to a user_mode_helper thread\nbefore it execs, but ptrace requires SIGSTOP to be delivered which can only\nhappen at user/kernel boundaries.\n3. /proc/*/task/*/syscall: this is perfectly happy to read pt_regs for\nuser_mode_helpers before the exec completes, but gp is not one of the\nregisters it returns.\n4. PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER: LOCKDOWN_PERF normally prevents access to kernel\naddresses via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR, but due to this bug kernel addresses\nare also exposed via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER which is permitted under\nLOCKDOWN_PERF. I have not attempted to write exploit code.\n5. Much of the tracing infrastructure allows access to user registers. I have\nnot attempted to determine which forms of tracing allow access to user\nregisters without already allowing access to kernel registers."
