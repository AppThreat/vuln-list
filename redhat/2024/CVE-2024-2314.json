    "If kernel headers need to be extracted, bcc will attempt to load them from a temporary directory. An unprivileged attacker could use this to force bcc to load compromised linux headers. Linux distributions which provide kernel headers by default are not affected by default.",

This issue could allow an attacker to force bcc to load compromised Linux headers by placing malicious headers in the temporary directory, leading to potential security risks, unauthorized access, or system compromise."
