It is simple to exploit, could significantly impact availability, and there is no reasonable mitigation. Once an attack has ended, the system should return to normal operations on its own.",

    "A vulnerability was found in how nghttp2 implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There are insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream. This issue could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up compute or memory resources to cause a Denial of Service."
