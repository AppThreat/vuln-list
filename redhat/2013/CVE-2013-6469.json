It may affect earlier versions of the upstream JBoss Overlord RTGov project.\nIn Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6, this flaw is mitigated by configuration options that either remove the vulnerable interface, or constrain it using a Java Security Manager policy. These options are documented in the Installation and Security Guides for the product.",
