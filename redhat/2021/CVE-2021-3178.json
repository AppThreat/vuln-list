As such, this is more of an hardening rather than security issue.",

  "details": [
    "fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.8, when there is an NFS export of a subdirectory of a filesystem, allows remote attackers to traverse to other parts of the filesystem via READDIRPLUS. NOTE: some parties argue that such a subdirectory export is not intended to prevent this attack; see also the exports(5) no_subtree_check default behavior",
    "A flaw leak of the file handle for parent directory in the Linux kernel's NFS3 functionality was found in the way user calls READDIRPLUS. A local user could use this flaw to traverse to other parts of the file-system than mounted sub-folder."
