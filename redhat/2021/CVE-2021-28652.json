  "mitigation": "To mitigate this flaw Cache Manager access privileges can be hardened, for example by requiring authentication or other access controls in the \"http_access\" directive beyond the default IP address restriction. Alternatively, Cache Manager access can be disabled entirely if not needed. To do so, place the following line in `squid.conf` before lines containing \"allow\" :\n```\nhttp_access deny manager\n```",

For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata.\nRed Hat Satellite does not ship the Squid package, however, does consume it from RHEL 7 repository. Product is not affected by this flaw as squid.conf configuration disables all the http_access fragments except the localhost.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to incorrect parser validation, it allows a Denial of Service attack against the Cache Manager API. This allows a trusted client to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is limited to clients with Cache Manager API access privilege.",
    "A flaw was found in Squid. A parser validation bug could allow a trusted client with Cache Manager API access privileges to trigger memory leaks, potentially resulting in a denial of service against Squid. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
