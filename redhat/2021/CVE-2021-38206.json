  "details": [
    "The mac80211 subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, when a device supporting only 5 GHz is used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference in the radiotap parser) by injecting a frame with 802.11a rates.",
    "A flaw was found on the Linux kernel.  A NULL pointer dereference in the radiotap parser, leading to a denial of service, can occur in the mac80211 subsystem when a device supports only 5 GHz is used and frames with 802.11a rates are injected. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
