    "An integer overflow was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's paravirtual RDMA device in versions prior to 6.1.0. The issue occurs while handling a \"PVRDMA_REG_DSRHIGH\" write from the guest due to improper input validation. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to make QEMU allocate a large amount of memory, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
