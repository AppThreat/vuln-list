    "GCC c++filt v2.26 was discovered to contain a use-after-free vulnerability via the component cplus-dem.c.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in binutilsâ€™ cxxfilt functionality. The attack needs to be initiated locally where an attacker could convince a victim to read a specially crafted file which is processed by cxxfilt, leading to disclosure of memory and possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code or causing the utility to crash."
