    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbinder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels\nIn 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d (\"android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space\")\nfixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,\nsizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so\nthe driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous\ntransactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.\nUnfortunately, on the \"free\" side, the accounting of async_free_space\ndid not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of\nasync_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or\nless.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue\nhas gone undetected for several years.\nThe fix is to use \"buffer_size\" (the allocated buffer size) instead of\n\"size\" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space\nduring the free operation. These are the same except for this\ncorner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads \u003c 8 bytes."
