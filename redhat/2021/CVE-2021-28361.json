  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) before 20.01.01. If a PDU is sent to the iSCSI target with a zero length (but data is expected), the iSCSI target can crash with a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "A flaw was found in the SPDK iSCSI target. A NULL pointer dereference resulted from a text PDU sent with a zero-length, resulting in a crash of the SPDK iCSCI target process. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
