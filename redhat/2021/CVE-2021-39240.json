  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before 2.4.3. It does not ensure that the scheme and path portions of a URI have the expected characters. For example, the authority field (as observed on a target HTTP/2 server) might differ from what the routing rules were intended to achieve.",
    "A flaw was found in haproxy. An input validation flaw when processing HTTP/2 requests causes haproxy to not ensure that the scheme and path portions of a URI have the expected characters.  This may cause specially crafted input to bypass implemented security restrictions. The highest threat from this vulnerability is confidentiality."
