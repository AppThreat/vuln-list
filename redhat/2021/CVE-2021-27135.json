  "mitigation": "This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling UTF-8 support in XTerm configuration.  An entry such as \"XTerm.vt100.utf8: false\" in Xresources will disable UTF-8.  This can be set as a system default in /etc/X11/Xresources, or per-user in ~/.Xresources.\nNote that this setting can still be overridden if xterm is invoked with the \"-u8\" command line option, so the mitigation may not protect all use cases.",
