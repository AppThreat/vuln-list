    "xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older do not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.",
    "A flaw was found in nodejs-xmldom. The xmldom library is an open-source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. Xmldom does not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from their ancestor. This flaw may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. Invalid processing of XML documents could lead to a loss of confidentiality or integrity of data in the application using the vulnerable library."
