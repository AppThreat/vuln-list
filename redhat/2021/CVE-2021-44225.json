  "details": [
    "In Keepalived through 2.2.4, the D-Bus policy does not sufficiently restrict the message destination, allowing any user to inspect and manipulate any property. This leads to access-control bypass in some situations in which an unrelated D-Bus system service has a settable (writable) property",
    "A flaw was found in keepalived, where an improper authentication vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to change properties that could lead to an access-control bypass."
