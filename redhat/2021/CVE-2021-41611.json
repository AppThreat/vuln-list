  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Squid 5.0.6 through 5.1.x before 5.2. When validating an origin server or peer certificate, Squid may incorrectly classify certain certificates as trusted. This problem allows a remote server to obtain security trust well improperly. This indication of trust may be passed along to clients, allowing access to unsafe or hijacked services.",
    "The squid proxy package may incorrectly classify certain certificates as trusted. This can allow traffic to obtain security trust when the trust is not valid. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
