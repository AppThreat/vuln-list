  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Grafana Loki through 2.2.1. The header value X-Scope-OrgID is used to construct file paths for rules files, and if crafted to conduct directory traversal such as ae ../../sensitive/path/in/deployment pathname, then Loki will attempt to parse a rules file at that location and include some of the contents in the error message.",
    "A flaw was found in Grafana Loki that could allow a remote attacker to traverse directories on the system, caused by improper input validation by the X-Scope-OrgID header value. An attacker could send a specially-crafted URL request containing \"dot dot\" sequences (/../) to view some of the contents in the error message."
