    "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. TiffDecode has a heap-based buffer overflow when decoding crafted YCbCr files because of certain interpretation conflicts with LibTIFF in RGBA mode. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-35654.",
    "A flaw was found in python-pillow. TiffDecode has a heap-based buffer overflow when decoding crafted YCbCr files because of certain interpretation conflicts with LibTIFF in RGBA mode. The previous fix for CVE-2020-35654 was insufficient due to incorrect error checking in TiffDecode.c. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
