    "The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.",
    "The patch for CVE-2020-17380 and CVE-2020-25085, both involving a heap buffer overflow in the SDHCI controller emulation code of QEMU,  was found to be incomplete. A malicious privileged guest could reproduce the same issues with specially crafted input, inducing a bogus transfer and subsequent out-of-bounds read/write access in sdhci_do_adma() or sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks(). CVE-2021-3409 was assigned to facilitate the tracking and backporting of the new patch."
