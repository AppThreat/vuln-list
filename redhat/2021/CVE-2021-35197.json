  "statement": "The mediawiki component was removed from OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) in version 4.3 onward. Therefore the OCP 4 component has been set as out of support scope (OOSS). Additionally, OCP 3.11 is in maintenance support for low and moderate impact vulnerabilities, hence the OCP 3.11 mediawiki component has also been set OOSS.",

  "details": [
    "In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access. When a bot account has a \"sitewide block\" applied, it is able to still \"purge\" pages through the MediaWiki Action API (which a \"sitewide block\" should have prevented).",
    "An improper authorization vulnerability was found in mediawiki. Mediawiki bots may have unintended API access even when a sitewide block has been applied. An attacker can use this vulnerability to potentially utilize a bot to access the mediawiki API and conduct actions like purge pages."
