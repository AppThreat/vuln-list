  "details": [
    "httplib2 is a comprehensive HTTP client library for Python. In httplib2 before version 0.19.0, a malicious server which responds with long series of \"\\xa0\" characters in the \"www-authenticate\" header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client accessing said server. This is fixed in version 0.19.0 which contains a new implementation of auth headers parsing using the pyparsing library.",
    "An uncontrolled resource consumption flaw as found in python-httplib2, due to a flawed regular expression used while parsing the WWW-Authenticate header in an HTTP response. This flaw allows a malicious or compromised server to reply with a crafted sequence of characters in the WWW-Authenticate header, leading to a denial of service of the httplib2 client accessing the server. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
