    "The Linux kernel before 5.11.14 has a use-after-free in cipso_v4_genopt in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c because the CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting for the DOI definitions is mishandled, aka CID-ad5d07f4a9cd. This leads to writing an arbitrary value.",
    "A flaw use-after-free in the Linux kernel CIPSO network packet labeling protocol functionality was found in the way user open local network connection with the usage of the security labeling that is IP option number 134. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system."
