Therefore these components are affected but with impact Low.\nRed Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 does not ship the directly affected code, however, they are still affected by this vulnerability because it allows the same configuration of anonymous snapshots, hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.",
