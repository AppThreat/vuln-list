  "statement": "In OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 (OCP) the openshift4/ose-prometheus container ships the vulnerable version of the merge-deep, however the Prometheus react-ui is disabled, hence this flaw cannot be exploited. As openshift4/ose-prometheus container still packages the vulnerable code, this component is affected with impact Low. This may be fixed in a future release.",

  "name": "CVE-2021-26707",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The merge-deep library before 3.0.3 for Node.js can be tricked into overwriting properties of Object.prototype or adding new properties to it. These properties are then inherited by every object in the program, thus facilitating prototype-pollution attacks against applications using this library."
