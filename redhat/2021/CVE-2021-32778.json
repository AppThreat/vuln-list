  "details": [
    "Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions envoyâ€™s procedure for resetting a HTTP/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. Deployments are susceptible to Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on H/2 concurrent streams. An attacker wishing to exploit this vulnerability would require a client opening and closing a large number of H/2 streams. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP/2 streams. As a workaround users may limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 dreams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 100.",
    "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability was found in envoyproxy/envoy. When envoy handles a large number of HTTP/2 requests which open and then reset the connection, it can cause excessive CPU usage. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service on the proxy. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
