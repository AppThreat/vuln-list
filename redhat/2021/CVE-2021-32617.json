  "statement": "Red Hat Product Security has marked the Impact of this flaw as Low because the denial of service caused by this flaw would not necessarily be persistent. Additionally, exploitation relies on parsing of arbitrary image files from untrusted sources, and the operation/command used to trigger it is not common amongst users according to the upstream advisory listed under \"References\" below.\nThis flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  "details": [
    "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An inefficient algorithm (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `rm`.",
    "There's a flaw in the xmpsdk component shipped with exiv2. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the exiv2 library could cause an excessive consumption of resources, potentially leading to denial of service. The greatest impact of this flaw is to system availability."
