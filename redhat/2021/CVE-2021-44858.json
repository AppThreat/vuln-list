    "An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x before 1.37.1. It is possible to use action=edit\u0026undo= followed by action=mcrundo and action=mcrrestore to view private pages on a private wiki that has at least one page set in $wgWhitelistRead.",
    "A flaw was found in mediawiki. The \"undo\" feature (action=edit\u0026undo=##\u0026undoafter=###) allowed an attacker to view the contents of arbitrary revisions, regardless of whether they had permissions to do so. This was also found in the \"mcrundo\" and \"mcrrestore\" actions (action=mcrundo and action=mcrrestore)."
