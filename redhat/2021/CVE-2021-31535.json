  "details": [
    "LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.",
    "A missing validation flaw was found in libX11. This flaw allows an attacker to inject X11 protocol commands on X clients, and in some cases, also bypass, authenticate (via injection of control characters), or potentially execute arbitrary code with permissions of the application compiled with libX11. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
