  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The xmlhttprequest-ssl package before 1.6.1 for Node.js disables SSL certificate validation by default, because rejectUnauthorized (when the property exists but is undefined) is considered to be false within the https.request function of Node.js. In other words, no certificate is ever rejected.",
    "A flaw was found in xmlhttprequest-ssl for Node.js. SSL certificate validation is disabled by default, due to rejectUnauthorized (when the property exists but is undefined) being considered to be false within the https.request function of Node.js (thus, no certificate is ever rejected). The highest threat from this vulnerablity is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
