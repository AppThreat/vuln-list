Hence, as the flaw is having LOW security impact, Red Hat Enterprise Linux - 8, 9 are set to not affected. However, RHEL-8 streams that ships libsolv versions prior to 0.7.17 are still affected. \nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle \u0026 Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Two heap-overflow vulnerabilities exist in openSUSE/libsolv libsolv through 13 Dec 2020 in the decisionmap variable via the resolve_dependencies function at src/solver.c (line 1940 \u0026 line 1995), which could cause a remote Denial of Service.",
    "A buffer over-read flaw was found in the test case reader in libsolv that created multiple out-of-bounds read symptoms. Depending on how client applications use libsolv, this flaw leads to a denial of service of the application if an attacker can supply crafted input to the test case reader."
