  "details": [
    "The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.",
    "A flaw was found in sudoedit. A race condition vulnerability and improper symbolic link resolution could be used by a local unprivileged user to test for the existence of directories and files not normally accessible to the user. This flaw cannot be used to read the content or write to arbitrary files on the file system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
