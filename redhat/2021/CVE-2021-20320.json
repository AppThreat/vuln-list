This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.\nA kernel update will be required to mitigate the flaw for the root or users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.",
