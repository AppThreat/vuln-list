    "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. PSDImagePlugin.PsdImageFile lacked a sanity check on the number of input layers relative to the size of the data block. This could lead to a DoS on Image.open prior to Image.load.",
    "A flaw was found in python-pillow. PsdImagePlugin.PsdImageFile does not sanity check the number of input layers with regard to the size of the data block which could lead to a denial-of-service."
