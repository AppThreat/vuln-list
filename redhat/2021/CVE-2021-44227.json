  "details": [
    "In GNU Mailman before 2.1.38, a list member or moderator can get a CSRF token and craft an admin request (using that token) to set a new admin password or make other changes.",
    "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack can be performed in mailman due to a CSRF token bypass. CSRF tokens are not checked against the right type of user when performing admin operations and a token created by a regular user can be used by an admin to perform an admin-level request, effectively bypassing the protection provided by CSRF tokens. A remote attacker with an account on the mailman system can use this flaw to perform a CSRF attack and perform operations on behalf of the victim admin."
