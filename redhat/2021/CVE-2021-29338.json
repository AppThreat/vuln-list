  "statement": "This flaw affects the opj2_compress utility but is not in the openjpeg2 library. Therefore, the attack vector is local to the opj2_compress utility and would require an attacker to convince a user to open a directory with an extremely large number of files using opj2_compress, or a script to be feeding such arbitrary, untrusted files to opj2_compress.",
  "acknowledgement": "",
  "name": "CVE-2021-29338",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Integer Overflow in OpenJPEG v2.4.0 allows remote attackers to crash the application, causing a Denial of Service (DoS). This occurs when the attacker uses the command line option \"-ImgDir\" on a directory that contains 1048576 files.",
    "There is a flaw in the opj2_compress program in openjpeg2. An attacker who is able to submit a large number of image files to be processed in a directory by opj2_compress, could trigger a heap out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow, which is caused by the large number of image files. The greatest threat posed by this flaw is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
