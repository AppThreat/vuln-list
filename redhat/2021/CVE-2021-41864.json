    "prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.",
    "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the bpf in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, the multiplication to calculate the size could lead to an integer overflow which could allow a local attacker, with a special user privilege, to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information."
