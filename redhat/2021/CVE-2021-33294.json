Since most elfutils tools are run in short-lived, local, interactive, development contexts rather than remotely \"in production\", we generally treat malfunctions as ordinary bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.\nThe version, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, is not affected by this vulnerability.",
