  "mitigation": "Only attackers that can connect to the `ptp4l` service can exploit this vulnerability. If `ptp4l` is bound only to a private network interface, or is protected by firewall rules to block incoming PTP management messages, the attack surface is correspondingly limited. When using the UDP IPv4 or IPv6 network transport, the following tcpdump filter can be used to detect PTP management messages:\n```\n(port 319 or port 320) and udp[8]\u00260xf=0xd\n```",

    "A flaw was found in the ptp4l program of the linuxptp package. A missing length check when forwarding a PTP message between ports allows a remote attacker to cause an information leak, crash, or potentially remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. This flaw affects linuxptp versions before 3.1.1, before 2.0.1, before 1.9.3, before 1.8.1, before 1.7.1, before 1.6.1 and before 1.5.1.",
