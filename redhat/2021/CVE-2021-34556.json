  "mitigation": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel setting prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF via the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. As such, exploiting this issue would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled. For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 (default) would mean that unprivileged users cannot use eBPF. Otherwise, to disable eBPF for unprivileged users, add:\nkernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1\nTo the file \"/etc/sysctl.d/disable-ebpf.conf\"\nThen running the following command as root:\n# sudo sysctl --system",
