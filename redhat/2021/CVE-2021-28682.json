    "An issue was discovered in Envoy through 1.71.1. There is a remotely exploitable integer overflow in which a very large grpc-timeout value leads to unexpected timeout calculations.",
    "A flaw was found in envoyproxy/envoy. An attacker, able to craft a packet which specifies a large grpc-timeout, can potentially cause envoy to incorrectly calculate the timeouts resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
