    "A flaw was found in ImageMagick where it did not properly sanitize certain input before using it to invoke convert processes. This flaw allows an attacker to create a specially crafted image that leads to a use-after-free vulnerability when processed by ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.",
