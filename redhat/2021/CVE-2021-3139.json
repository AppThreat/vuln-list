  "name": "CVE-2021-3139",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Open-iSCSI tcmu-runner 1.3.x, 1.4.x, and 1.5.x through 1.5.2, xcopy_locate_udev in tcmur_cmd_handler.c lacks a check for transport-layer restrictions, allowing remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. NOTE: relative to CVE-2020-28374, this is a similar mistake in a different algorithm.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s implementation of the Linux SCSI target host, where an authenticated attacker could write to any block on the exported SCSI device backing store. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to send LIO block requests to the Linux system to overwrite data on the backing store. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity. In addition, this flaw affects the tcmu-runner package, where the affected SCSI command is called."
