    "In append_to_verify_fifo_interleaved_ of stream_encoder.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-174302683",
    "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in libFlak. The vulnerability occurs due to a missing bounds check. This flaw allows a local attacker without additional execution privileges to cause local information disclosure."
