  "statement": "The improper neutralization of input vulnerability in DataTables.net is considered a moderate severity issue because, while it allows for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, it requires specific conditions to be exploited effectively. An attacker must have the ability to inject malicious input into the system, and the application must pass this input to the HTML escape entities function without proper validation. Although XSS can lead to significant security risks, such as session hijacking and data theft, the impact is somewhat mitigated by the necessity of these preconditions. Moreover, this vulnerability does not compromise the underlying server or database directly, limiting its scope primarily to client-side exploitation.",
