  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The users.digest file contains the sha2-512 digest of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string. The settings.yaml file contains secrets such as the hashed default password.",
    "A flaw was found in cobbler. The vulnerability occurs due to unsafe permissions on sensitive files in /etc/cobbler and leads to cleartext transmission. This flaw allows an attacker to interact and read sensitive configuration files."
