    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbtrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions\nOrdered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread\nwhich executed the normal work functions. The only way execution between\nnormal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,\nunfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.\nThis manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where\nasync_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes\nsubmit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because\nasync_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:\npc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0\nlr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0\nsp : ffff800015d4bc20\n\u003cregisters omitted for brevity\u003e\nCall trace:\nsubmit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0\nasync_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0\nrun_ordered_work+0xc8/0x280\nbtrfs_work_helper+0x98/0x250\nprocess_one_work+0x1f0/0x4ac\nworker_thread+0x188/0x504\nkthread+0x110/0x114\nret_from_fork+0x10/0x18\nFix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all\naccesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before\nsetting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of\nWORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads\nwould be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures\nare all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered\nbefore any access that can occur in ordered_func."
