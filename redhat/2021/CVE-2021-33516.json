    "An issue was discovered in GUPnP before 1.0.7 and 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.5. It allows DNS rebinding. A remote web server can exploit this vulnerability to trick a victim's browser into triggering actions against local UPnP services implemented using this library. Depending on the affected service, this could be used for data exfiltration, data tempering, etc.",
    "A flaw was found in gupnp. DNS rebinding can occur when a victim's browser is used by a remote web server to trigger actions against local UPnP services including data exfiltration, data tempering, and other exploits. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
