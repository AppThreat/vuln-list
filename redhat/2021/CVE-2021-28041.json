    "ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 8.5 has a double free that may be relevant in a few less-common scenarios, such as unconstrained agent-socket access on a legacy operating system, or the forwarding of an agent to an attacker-controlled host.",
    "A double-free memory corruption flaw was found in OpenSSH 8.2, more specifically in ssh-agent application. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the agent socket to forward an agent either to an account shared with a malicious user or to a host with an attacker holding root access. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
