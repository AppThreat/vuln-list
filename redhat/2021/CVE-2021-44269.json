  "details": [
    "An out of bounds read was found in Wavpack 5.4.0 in processing *.WAV files. This issue triggered in function WavpackPackSamples of file src/pack_utils.c, tainted variable cnt is too large, that makes pointer sptr read beyond heap bound.",
    "A heap out-of-bounds read flaw was found in WavPacks' WavpackPackSamples() function of src/pack_utils.c and only affects the command-line program of WavPack (not libwavpack). This flaw allows an attacker to exploit this flaw for a website that uses the WavPack command-line program on user-provided files, causing a denial of service."
