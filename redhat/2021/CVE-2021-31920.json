  "details": [
    "Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 has a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request path with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters (%2F or %5C) could potentially bypass an Istio authorization policy when path based authorization rules are used.",
    "An authorization bypass flaw was found in Istio. This flaw allows an attacker to craft an HTTP request that defines a certain pattern of escaped characters in the URI path (such as %2F, %2f, %5C, or %5c), allowing them to bypass the authorization service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
