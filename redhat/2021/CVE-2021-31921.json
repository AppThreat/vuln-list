  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.",
    "An authorization bypass vulnerability was found in istio. When the istio gateway is configured with TLS mode `AUTO_PASSTHROUGH`, it is possible for a malicious user to bypass the authorization checks and gain access to protected services. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
