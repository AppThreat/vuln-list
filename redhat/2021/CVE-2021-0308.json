  "name": "CVE-2021-0308",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In ReadLogicalParts of basicmbr.cc, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android; Versions: Android-8.1, Android-9, Android-10, Android-11, Android-8.0; Android ID: A-158063095.",
    "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in gdisks' ReadLogicalParts() function of 'basicmbr.cc'. The exploitation of this flaw requires the use of a malicious storage device (for example, a USB Stick) that can cause a crash when physically inserted into the system and possible local privilege escalation. This flaw allows an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity, and data availability."
