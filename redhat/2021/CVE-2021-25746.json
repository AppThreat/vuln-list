    "A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where a user that can create or update ingress objects can use .metadata.annotations in an Ingress object (in the networking.k8s.io or extensions API group) to obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.",
    "A flaw was found in the ingress-nginx controller. When a user creates or updates ingress objects, credentials of the ingress-nginx controller can be obtained by accessing .metadata.annotations."
