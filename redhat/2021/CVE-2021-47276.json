    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()\nIt was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for\nupdating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)\nreturned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to\noccur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report\nwhat was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This\ncaused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory\naddress.\nInstead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely\naccess the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,\notherwise report what was in that location."
