    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ndrm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP\nIn commit 510410bfc034 (\"drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object\nfunction\") we switched to a new/cleaner method of doing things. That's\ngood, but we missed a little bit.\nBefore that commit, we used to _first_ run through the\ndrm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj-\u003efuncs-\u003emmap()` was NULL. That meant\nthat we ran:\nvma-\u003evm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;\nvma-\u003evm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma-\u003evm_flags));\nvma-\u003evm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma-\u003evm_page_prot);\n...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own. Now that\n`obj-\u003efuncs-\u003emmap()` is no longer NULL we don't run the default\ncode. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags got VM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP\nwas important because we're now getting crashes on Chromebooks that\nuse ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash that looks like this\n(this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but also seen on a\n5.15 kernel):\nUnable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffffc008000000\nMem abort info:\nESR = 0x96000006\nEC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\nSET = 0, FnV = 0\nEA = 0, S1PTW = 0\nData abort info:\nISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000006\nCM = 0, WnR = 0\nswapper pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=000000008293d000\n[ffffffc008000000] pgd=00000001002b3003, p4d=00000001002b3003,\npud=00000001002b3003, pmd=0000000000000000\nInternal error: Oops: 96000006 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[...]\nCPU: 7 PID: 15734 Comm: crash_dump64 Tainted: G W 5.10.67 #1 [...]\nHardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. sc7280 IDP SKU2 platform (DT)\npstate: 80400009 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--)\npc : __arch_copy_to_user+0xc0/0x30c\nlr : copyout+0xac/0x14c\n[...]\nCall trace:\n__arch_copy_to_user+0xc0/0x30c\ncopy_page_to_iter+0x1a0/0x294\nprocess_vm_rw_core+0x240/0x408\nprocess_vm_rw+0x110/0x16c\n__arm64_sys_process_vm_readv+0x30/0x3c\nel0_svc_common+0xf8/0x250\ndo_el0_svc+0x30/0x80\nel0_svc+0x10/0x1c\nel0_sync_handler+0x78/0x108\nel0_sync+0x184/0x1c0\nCode: f8408423 f80008c3 910020c6 36100082 (b8404423)\nLet's add the two flags back in.\nWhile we're at it, the fact that we aren't running the default means\nthat we _don't_ need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save\nan instruction.\nNOTE: it was confirmed that VM_IO was the important flag to fix the\nproblem I was seeing, but adding back VM_DONTDUMP seems like a sane\nthing to do so I'm doing that too."
