  "details": [
    "GNU cpio through 2.13 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted pattern file, because of a dstring.c ds_fgetstr integer overflow that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are common cases where the pattern file, associated with the -E option, is untrusted data.",
    "A flaw was found in cpio. An integer overflow that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted pattern file. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
