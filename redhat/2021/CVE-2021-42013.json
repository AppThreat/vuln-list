  "details": [
    "It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied\", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.",
    "A path traversal and remote code execution flaw was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50. A remote attacker could use this flaw to map URLs to files outside the expected document root. Additionally, this flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied\", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased paths, this could allow for remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. This is an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-41773."
