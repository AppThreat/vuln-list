  "details": [
    "Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (affecting availability to all clients) via an HTTP response. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent by the server.",
    "An input validation flaw was found in Squid. This issue could allow a remote server to perform a denial of service against all clients using the proxy when delivering HTTP response messages. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
