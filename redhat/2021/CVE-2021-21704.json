  "details": [
    "In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using Firebird PDO driver extension, a malicious database server could cause crashes in various database functions, such as getAttribute(), execute(), fetch() and others by returning invalid response data that is not parsed correctly by the driver. This can result in crashes, denial of service or potentially memory corruption.",
    "Several flaws has been found in php. The pdo_firebase module does not check the length of the server version string in a response packet causing a stack buffer overflow, does not verify the data and uses the wrong type to cast length leading to a crash, and does not validate the response before calculation of the exec procedure leading to a crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
