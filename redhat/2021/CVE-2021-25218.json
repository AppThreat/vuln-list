  "details": [
    "In BIND 9.16.19, 9.17.16. Also, version 9.16.19-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition When a vulnerable version of named receives a query under the circumstances described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion check. The vulnerability affects only BIND 9 releases 9.16.19, 9.17.16, and release 9.16.19-S1 of the BIND Supported Preview Edition.",
    "A flaw was found in bind. An assertion failure is triggered, resulting in termination of the named server process, if named attempts to respond over UDP with a response that is larger than the current effective interface maximum transmission unit (MTU), and if response-rate limiting (RRL) is active. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
