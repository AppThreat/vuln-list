For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata.\nRed Hat Satellite does not ship the Squid package, however, does consume it from RHEL 7 repository. Product is not affected by this flaw as squid.conf configuration disables all the http_access fragments except the localhost.",
