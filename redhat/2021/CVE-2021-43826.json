  "details": [
    "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions of Envoy a crash occurs when configured for :ref:`upstream tunneling \u003cenvoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.tunneling_config\u003e` and the downstream connection disconnects while the the upstream connection or http/2 stream is still being established. There are no workarounds for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.",
    "A flaw was found in envoy. If a downstream source disconnects during upstream connection establishment when tunneling TCP over HTTP, a use-after-free can occur, resulting in a denial of service."
