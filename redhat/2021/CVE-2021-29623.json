  "details": [
    "Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A read of uninitialized memory was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The read of uninitialized memory is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to leak a few bytes of stack memory, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.",
    "There's a flaw in exiv2's isWebPType() function. An attacker who submits a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with exiv2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read of unitialized memory, saving it to the stack. The great impact of this flaw is most likely to application availability with some potential impact to data confidentiality."
