  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in ncurses through v6.2-1. _nc_captoinfo in captoinfo.c has a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "A heap overflow vulnerability has been found in the ncurses package, particularly in the \"tic\". This flaw results from a lack of proper bounds checking during input processing. By exploiting this boundary error, an attacker can create a malicious file, deceive the victim into opening it using the affected software, and initiate an out-of-bounds write, potentially impacting system availability."
