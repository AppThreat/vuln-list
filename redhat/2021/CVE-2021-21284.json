  "details": [
    "In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using \"--userns-remap\", if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under \"/var/lib/docker/\u003cremapping\u003e\" that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.",
    "A flaw was found in the `userns-remap` feature of Docker. The root user in the remapped namespace can modify files under /var/lib/docker/\u003cremapping\u003e, leading to possible privilege escalation to the root user in the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity."
