  "statement": "OpenSSL packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are not compiled with support for SM2 algorithm and therefore are not affected by this flaw.

  "name": "CVE-2021-3711",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).",
    "A flaw was found in openssl. A miscalculation of a buffer size was found in openssl's SM2 decryption function, allowing up to 62 arbitrary bytes to be written outside of the buffer. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application supporting SM2 signature or encryption algorithm, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
