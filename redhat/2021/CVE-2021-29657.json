  "details": [
    "arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A KVM guest on AMD can launch a nested guest without the Intercept VMRUN control bit by exploiting a TOCTOU vulnerability in nested_svm_vmrun. A malicious guest could use this flaw to gain unrestricted access to host MSRs, possibly leading to guest-to-host escape scenario."
