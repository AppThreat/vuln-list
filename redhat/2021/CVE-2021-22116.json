  "statement": "While Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships the affected rabbitmq-server package, RabbitMQ is not exposed outside the management network. As this network is tightly-regulated to OpenStack administrators, the risk for abuse is significantly reduced. Additionally, by default the affected plugin (AMQP 1.0) is not enabled. No update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP rabbitmq-server package.",

  "details": [
    "RabbitMQ all versions prior to 3.8.16 are prone to a denial of service vulnerability due to improper input validation in AMQP 1.0 client connection endpoint. A malicious user can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious AMQP messages to the target RabbitMQ instance having the AMQP 1.0 plugin enabled.",
    "A flaw was found in rabbitmq-server, where insufficient input validation in the AMQP 1.0 client connection endpoint could allow a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
