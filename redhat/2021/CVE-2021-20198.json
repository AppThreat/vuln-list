  "mitigation": "This issue is mitigated by default on AWS, Azure, GCP and OpenStack as port 10250 is not remotely accessible on bootstrap nodes. For other IPI platforms, bootstrap nodes only exist during the installation window so the exposure is limited. For UPI installations, administrators should prevent remote access to this port on bootstrap nodes and/or remove the nodes once installation is complete",

    "A flaw was found in the OpenShift Installer before version v0.9.0-master.0.20210125200451-95101da940b0. During installation of OpenShift Container Platform 4 clusters, bootstrap nodes are provisioned with anonymous authentication enabled on kubelet port 10250. A remote attacker able to reach this port during installation can make unauthenticated `/exec` requests to execute arbitrary commands within running containers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
