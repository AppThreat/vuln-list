    "An issue was discovered in Squid 4.x before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. If a remote server sends a certain response header over HTTP or HTTPS, there is a denial of service. This header can plausibly occur in benign network traffic.",
    "An input validation flaw was found in Squid. This issue could allow a remote server to perform a denial of service against all clients using the proxy when delivering HTTP response messages. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
