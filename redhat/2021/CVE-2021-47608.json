    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic fetch\nThe change in commit 37086bfdc737 (\"bpf: Propagate stack bounds to registers\nin atomics w/ BPF_FETCH\") around check_mem_access() handling is buggy since\nthis would allow for unprivileged users to leak kernel pointers. For example,\nan atomic fetch/and with -1 on a stack destination which holds a spilled\npointer will migrate the spilled register type into a scalar, which can then\nbe exported out of the program (since scalar != pointer) by dumping it into\na map value.\nThe original implementation of XADD was preventing this situation by using\na double call to check_mem_access() one with BPF_READ and a subsequent one\nwith BPF_WRITE, in both cases passing -1 as a placeholder value instead of\nregister as per XADD semantics since it didn't contain a value fetch. The\nBPF_READ also included a check in check_stack_read_fixed_off() which rejects\nthe program if the stack slot is of __is_pointer_value() if dst_regno \u003c 0.\nThe latter is to distinguish whether we're dealing with a regular stack spill/\nfill or some arithmetical operation which is disallowed on non-scalars, see\nalso 6e7e63cbb023 (\"bpf: Forbid XADD on spilled pointers for unprivileged\nusers\") for more context on check_mem_access() and its handling of placeholder\nvalue -1.\nOne minimally intrusive option to fix the leak is for the BPF_FETCH case to\ninitially check the BPF_READ case via check_mem_access() with -1 as register,\nfollowed by the actual load case with non-negative load_reg to propagate\nstack bounds to registers."
