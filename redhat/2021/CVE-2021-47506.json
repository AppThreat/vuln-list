    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race\nA delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A\ndelegation break runs a callback which immediately (in\nnfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we\nthen exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be\nfreed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being\nremoved from del_recall_lru.\nSymptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,\nusually in the laundromat thread.\nI suspect aba2072f4523 \"nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding\nwrites\" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0\nand it looks to me it already had the same problem.  So I'm not sure\nwhere the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning."
