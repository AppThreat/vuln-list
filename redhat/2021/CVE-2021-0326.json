  "details": [
    "In p2p_copy_client_info of p2p.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to remote code execution if the target device is performing a Wi-Fi Direct search, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1 Android-9Android ID: A-172937525",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) support of wpa_supplicant. This flaw allows an attacker within radio range of the vulnerable system to send a specially crafted management frame that triggers a P2P peer device information to be created or updated, leading to the crashing of the wpa_supplicant process or arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
