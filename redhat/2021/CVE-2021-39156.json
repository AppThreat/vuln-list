  "details": [
    "Istio is an open source platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data. Istio 1.11.0, 1.10.3 and below, and 1.9.7 and below contain a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with `#fragment` in the path may bypass Istioâ€™s URI path based authorization policies. Patches are available in Istio 1.11.1, Istio 1.10.4 and Istio 1.9.8. As a work around a Lua filter may be written to normalize the path.",
    "An authorization bypass vulnerability was found in istio/istio. An HTTP request is incorrectly evaluated when a URI #fragment is specified. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass an Istio URI-based authorization rule. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
