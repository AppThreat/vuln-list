    "An issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before 2.4.3. It can lead to a situation with an attacker-controlled HTTP Host header, because a mismatch between Host and authority is mishandled.",
    "haproxy was found to be vulnerable to HTTP host header attack: This problem creates a scenario in which it's possible to drop the Host header and use the authority only after forwarding to a\nsecond http2 layer,  possibly causing two differing values of Host at a different stage. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data integrity."
