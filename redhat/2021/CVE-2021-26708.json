  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Wrong locking in the AF_VSOCK socket can cause a local privilege escalation, bypassing SMEP and SMAP. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
