  "details": [
    "Cobbler before 3.3.0 allows log poisoning, and resultant Remote Code Execution, via an XMLRPC method that logs to the logfile for template injection.",
    "A flaw was found in cobbler. This flaw lies in the generate_script RPC method, which accepts unsanitized parameters. This flaw allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system as root. Further, the attacker could gain arbitrary code execution using template injection against the default Cheetah template engine, leading to the exposure of sensitive information or execution of arbitrary code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
