  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x before 1.37.1. It is possible to use action=mcrundo followed by action=mcrrestore to replace the content of any arbitrary page (that the user doesn't have edit rights for). This applies to any public wiki, or a private wiki that has at least one page set in $wgWhitelistRead.",
    "A flaw was found in mediawiki. The \"mcrundo\" and \"mcrrestore\" actions (action=mcrundo and action=mcrrestore) did not properly check for editing permissions and allowed an attacker to take the content of any arbitrary revision and save it on any page of their choosing. This affects both public wikis and public pages on private wikis."
