    "An issue was discovered in Envoy through 1.71.1. There is a remotely exploitable NULL pointer dereference and crash in TLS when an unknown TLS alert code is received.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found envoyproxy/envoy. This flaw allows an attacker to establish a TLS session that sends an invalid TLS alert code, causing a NULL pointer exception to occur that crashes the application, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
