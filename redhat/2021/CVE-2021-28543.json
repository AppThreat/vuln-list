  "details": [
    "Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference issue was found in Varnish Cache through the 'header' module from the separate varnish-modules package. This flaw might allow for remote clients to cause Varnish to assert and restart, reducing overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on back-end servers. There is no potential for remote code execution or data leaks related to this vulnerability."
