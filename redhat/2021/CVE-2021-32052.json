  "details": [
    "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.",
    "A flaw was found in django. On Python 3.9.5+, `URLValidator` didn't prohibited newlines and tabs which could lead to a header injection attack if these were used in an HTTP response. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
