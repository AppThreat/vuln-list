  "mitigation": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel setting prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF via the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. As such, exploiting this issue would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled. For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 (default) would mean that unprivileged users cannot use eBPF. Otherwise, to disable eBPF for unprivileged users, add:\nkernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1\nTo the file \"/etc/sysctl.d/disable-ebpf.conf\"\nThen running the following command as root:\n# sudo sysctl --system",

    "In kernel/bpf/hashtab.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.8, there is an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write when many elements are placed in a single bucket. NOTE: exploitation might be impractical without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. An integer overflow can allow an out-of-bounds write when many elements are placed in a hash's bucket. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
