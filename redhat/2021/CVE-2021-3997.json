  "statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 has a default 1024 nofile limit, thus preventing `systemd-tmpfiles` from exhausting its stack and crashing. For this reason, this flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. For more information on default ulimit values, please see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4482841.\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) systemd package was shipped with OCP 4.7 as a one-off instance and all the later OCP releases (4.8, 4.9) are using systemd from RHEL 8. Hence, the systemd package shipped with OCP 4.7 will not be fixed and the fix will be consumed from RHEL 8.",
