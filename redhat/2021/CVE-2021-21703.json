  "details": [
    "In PHP versions 7.3.x up to and including 7.3.31, 7.4.x below 7.4.25 and 8.0.x below 8.0.12, when running PHP FPM SAPI with main FPM daemon process running as root and child worker processes running as lower-privileged users, it is possible for the child processes to access memory shared with the main process and write to it, modifying it in a way that would cause the root process to conduct invalid memory reads and writes, which can be used to escalate privileges from local unprivileged user to the root user.",
    "php-fpm has a vulnerability which may lead to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability is hard to exploit as the attack needs to escape the FPM sandbox mechanism. When a complete attack is achieved it may lead to risk for confidentiality, data integrity, and system availability."
