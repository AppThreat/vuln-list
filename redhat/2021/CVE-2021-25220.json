    "BIND 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.36 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.16.26 9.17.0 -\u003e 9.18.0 BIND Supported Preview Editions: 9.11.4-S1 -\u003e 9.11.36-S1 9.16.8-S1 -\u003e 9.16.26-S1 Versions of BIND 9 earlier than those shown - back to 9.1.0, including Supported Preview Editions - are also believed to be affected but have not been tested as they are EOL. The cache could become poisoned with incorrect records leading to queries being made to the wrong servers, which might also result in false information being returned to clients.",
    "A cache poisoning vulnerability was found in BIND when using forwarders. Bogus NS records supplied by the forwarders may be cached and used by name if it needs to recurse for any reason. This issue causes it to obtain and pass on potentially incorrect answers. This flaw allows a remote high privileged attacker to manipulate cache results with incorrect records, leading to queries made to the wrong servers, possibly resulting in false information received on the client's end."
