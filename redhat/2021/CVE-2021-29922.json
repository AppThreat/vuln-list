  "details": [
    "library/std/src/net/parser.rs in Rust before 1.53.0 does not properly consider extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address string, which (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses, because of unexpected octal interpretation.",
    "A flaw was found in rust. Extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address string are not properly considered which can allow an attacker to bypass IP-based access controls. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
