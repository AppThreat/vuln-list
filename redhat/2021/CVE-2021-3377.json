    "The npm package ansi_up converts ANSI escape codes into HTML. In ansi_up v4, ANSI escape codes can be used to create HTML hyperlinks. Due to insufficient URL sanitization, this feature is affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This issue is fixed in v5.0.0.",
    "A flaw was found in npm package ansi_up versions \u003c 5.0.0 when parsing untrusted user input. An attacker could take advantage of this by introducing ANSI escape codes to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in result mounting a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack."
