  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3002.5. Sending crafted web requests to the Salt API can result in salt.utils.thin.gen_thin() command injection because of different handling of single versus double quotes. This is related to salt/utils/thin.py.",
    "A flaw was found in salt. Command injection using the SaltAPI, is possible due to json.dumps() escaping double quotes while leaving the single quotes untouched. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
