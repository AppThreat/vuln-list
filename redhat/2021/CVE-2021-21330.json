We may update the python-aiohttp dependency in a future release.",

  "name": "CVE-2021-21330",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In aiohttp before version 3.7.4 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-server could redirect the browser to a different website. It is caused by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware. This security problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency using pip as follows \"pip install aiohttp \u003e= 3.7.4\". If upgrading is not an option for you, a workaround can be to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your applications.",
    "An open redirect flaw was found in python-aiohttp. This flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trick users into visiting a malicious webpage, disguised as a legitimate webpage and affects applications using the normalize_path_middleware functionality. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
