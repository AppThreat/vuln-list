  "details": [
    "report_vbuild in report.c in Fetchmail before 6.4.20 sometimes omits initialization of the vsnprintf va_list argument, which might allow mail servers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via long error messages. NOTE: it is unclear whether use of Fetchmail on any realistic platform results in an impact beyond an inconvenience to the client user.",
    "A flaw was found in fetchmail. The flaw lies in how fetchmail when running in verbose mode using the -v flag tries to log long messages that are created from long headers. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service attack or crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data availability. This flaw was earlier identified by CVE-2008-2711 and fixed, however it recently got reintroduced due to a code refactoring issue. The current bug fix applies a different approach than the earlier one."
