  "details": [
    "In function read_yin_leaf() in libyang \u003c= v1.0.225, it doesn't check whether the value of retval-\u003eext[r] is NULL. In some cases, it can be NULL, which leads to the operation of retval-\u003eext[r]-\u003eflags that results in a crash.",
    "A flaw was found in libyang. Missing checks in several read_yin_* functions lead to NULL pointer dereferences possibly allowing a remote attacker to crash an application that uses libyang with user-controlled YIN formats. The highest threat from this vulnerability is the service availability."
