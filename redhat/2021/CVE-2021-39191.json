  "details": [
    "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In versions prior to 2.4.9.4, the 3rd-party init SSO functionality of mod_auth_openidc was reported to be vulnerable to an open redirect attack by supplying a crafted URL in the `target_link_uri` parameter. A patch in version 2.4.9.4 made it so that the `OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed` setting must be applied to the `target_link_uri` parameter. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.",
    "A open redirect flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc where it does not sanitize target_link_uri paramater properly. This issue could be used by a remote attacker to facilitate phishing attacks by tricking users into visiting a trusted web application URL that redirects to an external and potentially malicious server. As a result of this redirection victim users may give more credibility to the attacker controlled server because coming from a trusted application."
