    "It was discovered that in the ovirt's REST API before version 4.3.2.1, RemoveDiskCommand is triggered as an internal command, meaning the permission validation that should be performed against the calling user is skipped. A user with low privileges (eg Basic Operations) could exploit this flaw to delete disks attached to guests.",
