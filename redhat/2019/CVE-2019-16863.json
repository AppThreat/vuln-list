  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "STMicroelectronics ST33TPHF2ESPI TPM devices before 2019-09-12 allow attackers to extract the ECDSA private key via a side-channel timing attack because ECDSA scalar multiplication is mishandled, aka TPM-FAIL.",
    "Cryptographic timing vulnerabilities were discovered in certain versions of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) firmware distributed by Intel and STMicroelectronics. Software that uses the TPM to compute ECDSA signatures could leak information through the timing of ECDSA signature operations, allowing an attacker to recover parts of the private key."
