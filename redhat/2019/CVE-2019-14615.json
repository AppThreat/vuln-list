  "mitigation": "Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system; however, the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See the kcs “How do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?“  (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module from autoloading. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly.\nThis mitigation may not be suitable if the graphical login functionality is required.",
