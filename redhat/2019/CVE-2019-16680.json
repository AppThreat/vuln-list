  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in GNOME file-roller before 3.29.91. It allows a single ./../ path traversal via a filename contained in a TAR archive, possibly overwriting a file during extraction.",
    "A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in the file-roller (Archive Manager for GNOME) in the way file paths with special characters are sanitized. Archives containing the sequence of characters \"../\" in a file path may be vulnerable to this flaw. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted archive with a file inside one or more sub-directories. When opened by a victim, the file-roller would extract the file in the current working directory instead of a sub-directory, as it may be expected by inspecting the archive."
