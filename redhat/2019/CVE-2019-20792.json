    "OpenSC before 0.20.0 has a double free in coolkey_free_private_data because coolkey_add_object in libopensc/card-coolkey.c lacks a uniqueness check.",
    "A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in OpenSC while disconnecting a smart card. This flaw allows a physical attacker to exploit this vulnerability by inserting and removing a malicious smart card, handled by the coolkey driver, that could potentially execute code on the target system, with privileges that depend on the particular configuration and system that makes use of the OpenSC library."
