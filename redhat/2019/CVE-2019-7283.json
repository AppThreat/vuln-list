  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in rcp in NetKit through 0.17. For an rcp operation, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client machine. This is similar to CVE-2019-6111.",
    "A vulnerability was found in rsh. The vulnerability occurs due to a possible overwrite of arbitrary files by a malicious rsh server. This flaw allows an attacker or a malicious rsh server (or a Man-in-The-Middle attacker) to overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client machine."
