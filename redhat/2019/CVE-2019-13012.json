  "statement": "This issue affects glib2 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and 8 and was rated as having a Low security impact by Red Hat Product Security team.\nAlthough Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions above ships the vulnerable code the flaw itself is not currently exploitable due to the presence of another glib2 bug (rhbz#1728896).\nThis bug avoid glib's 'keyfile' module to be loaded at glib2 initialization, thus the vulnerable code is currently unreachable.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Low, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The keyfile settings backend in GNOME GLib (aka glib2.0) before 2.60.0 creates directories using g_file_make_directory_with_parents (kfsb-\u003edir, NULL, NULL) and files using g_file_replace_contents (kfsb-\u003efile, contents, length, NULL, FALSE, G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION, NULL, NULL, NULL). Consequently, it does not properly restrict directory (and file) permissions. Instead, for directories, 0777 permissions are used; for files, default file permissions are used. This is similar to CVE-2019-12450."
