    "SoX - Sound eXchange 14.4.2 and earlier is affected by: Out-of-bounds Read. The impact is: Denial of Service. The component is: read_samples function at xa.c:219. The attack vector is: Victim must open specially crafted .xa file. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2017-18189.",
    "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in sox, due to insufficient validation of input data. An attacker could abuse this flaw by crafting a sound file that can cause the system to crash when read by sox or by an application using the sox library."
