  "name": "CVE-2019-16786",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and only look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would fall through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.",
    "An HTTP-interpretation flaw was found in waitress which did not properly validate incoming HTTP headers. When parsing the Transfer-Encoding header, waitress would look only for a single string value. According to the HTTP standard, Transfer-Encoding should be a comma-separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with 'chunked'. Because of this flaw, requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\" would get ignored, and waitress would use the Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to force waitress to accept potentially bad HTTP requests or treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining."
