  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt before 6.0.0 mishandles the holding of a monitor job during a query to a guest agent, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (API blockage).",
    "A flaw was found in the way the libvirtd daemon issued the 'suspend' command to a QEMU guest-agent running inside a guest, where it holds a monitor job while issuing the 'suspend' command to a guest-agent. A malicious guest-agent may use this flaw to block the libvirt daemon indefinitely, resulting in a denial of service."
