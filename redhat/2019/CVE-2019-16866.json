  "statement": "This issue has been classified as having low security impact because:\n- per default, unbound is not configured to listen on a public interface\n- per default, the ACL is limited to localhost, so even if listening to a public interface, the crash cannot happen per default\nIt mostly affects people running unbound as a \"public\" DNS resolver. Using such configurations, unbound has no valuable secrets that could be obtained by a successful attack, so at best the server crashes and restarts, resulting in an empty DNS cache. Sustained sending of packets would result in a DoS though.",
