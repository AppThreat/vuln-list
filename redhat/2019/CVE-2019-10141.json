    "A vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector all versions excluding 5.0.2, 6.0.3, 7.2.4, 8.0.3 and 8.2.1. A SQL-injection vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes a SQL query using unfiltered data from a server reporting inspection results (by a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint). Because the API is unauthenticated, the flaw could be exploited by an attacker with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening. Because of how ironic-inspector uses the query results, it is unlikely that data could be obtained. However, the attacker could pass malicious data and create a denial of service.",
