  "details": [
    "A buffer overflow in the fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex() function in lib/fribidi-bidi.c of GNU FriBidi through 1.0.7 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code by delivering crafted text content to a user, when this content is then rendered by an application that uses FriBidi for text layout calculations. Examples include any GNOME or GTK+ based application that uses Pango for text layout, as this internally uses FriBidi for bidirectional text layout. For example, the attacker can construct a crafted text file to be opened in GEdit, or a crafted IRC message to be viewed in HexChat.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in GNU FriBidi, an implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (bidi). When the flaw is triggered it's possible to manipulate the heap contents, leading to memory corruption causing a denial of service and to arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this flaw to both data and system availability."
