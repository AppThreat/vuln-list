  "details": [
    "SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9 has a heap-based buffer over-read in BlitNtoN in video/SDL_blit_N.c when called from SDL_SoftBlit in video/SDL_blit.c.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in SDL in the SDL_BlitCopy() function, that was called while copying an existing surface into a new optimized one, due to lack of validation while loading a BMP image in the SDL_LoadBMP_RW() function. An application that uses SDL to parse untrusted input files may be vulnerable to this flaw, which could allow an attacker to make the application crash or possibly execute code."
