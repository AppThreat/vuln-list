  "details": [
    "Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered user email address.)",
    "A flaw was found in Django where it did not sanitize the email input from the password recovery form. An attacker with the knowledge of the victim user’s email address could use this flaw to reset the victim user’s password and retrieve the reset link to gain access and take over their account."
