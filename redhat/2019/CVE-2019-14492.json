  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 3.4.7 and 4.x before 4.1.1. There is an out of bounds read/write in the function HaarEvaluator::OptFeature::calc in modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp, which leads to denial of service.",
    "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in OpenCV in the way the Cascade Classifier algorithm loaded and processed the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers. This flaw allows a remote attacker to provide a specially crafted classifier in the form of an XML file that, when loaded by an application linked to OpenCV, would crash the application, causing a denial of service."
