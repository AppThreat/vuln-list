    "A flaw was found in ansible 2.8.0 before 2.8.4. Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by no_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set properly. service_account_contents() which is common class for all gcp modules is not setting no_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.",
    "A flaw was found in the gcp module of ansible. Certain fields managing sensitive data should be marked by the no_log feature. The service_account_contents(), which is common class for all gcp modules, is not being set as no_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be leaked as an output when running ansible playbooks. Data confidentiality is the highest threat with this vulnerability."
