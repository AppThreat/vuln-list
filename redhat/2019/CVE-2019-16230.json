  "statement": "This issue is rated as having Low impact because of the preconditions needed to trigger the error/resource cleanup code path (system-wide out-of-memory condition, high privileges or physical access). The attacker would have to be able to induce system-wide out-of-memory condition which itself could be seen as a local denial of service. It could be argued that having such privileges has the same impact as the flaw itself.",

  "name": "CVE-2019-16230",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: A third-party software maintainer states that the work queue allocation is happening during device initialization, which for a graphics card occurs during boot. It is not attacker controllable and OOM at that time is highly unlikely",
    "A flaw was found in the radeon_crtc_init function of the Linux kernel. The kernel doesn't handle work queue allocation failures correctly leading to a crash of the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
