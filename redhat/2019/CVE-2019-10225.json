    "A flaw was found in atomic-openshift of openshift-4.2 where the basic-user RABC role in OpenShift Container Platform doesn't sufficiently protect the GlusterFS StorageClass against leaking of the restuserkey. An attacker with basic-user permissions is able to obtain the value of restuserkey, and use it to authenticate to the GlusterFS REST service, gaining access to read, and modify files.",
