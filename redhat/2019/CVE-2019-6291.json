  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in the function expr6 in eval.c in Netwide Assembler (NASM) through 2.14.02. There is a stack exhaustion problem caused by the expr6 function making recursive calls to itself in certain scenarios involving lots of '!' or '+' or '-' characters. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted asm file."
