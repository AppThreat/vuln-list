Passwords should be wrapped to prevent templates trigger and exposing them.",
    "A data disclosure flaw was found in ansible. Password prompts in ansible-playbook and ansible-cli tools could expose passwords with special characters as they are not properly wrapped. A password with special characters is exposed starting with the first of these special characters. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
