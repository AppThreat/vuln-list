  "statement": "This flaw does not affect the versions of sysstat as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they do not include support for `extra_desc` structures in binary data files created by the `sar` command. Consequently, they do not include the vulnerable code leading to the double free vulnerability either.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "sysstat through 12.2.0 has a double free in check_file_actlst in sa_common.c.",
    "A double-free vulnerability was found in sysstat in the way the `sadf` command processes the contents of data files created by the `sar` command. Saved binary data files with support for `extra_desc` structures may be vulnerable to this flaw. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted file with malformed data that, when loaded by a victim, would cause the application to potentially execute arbitrary code."
