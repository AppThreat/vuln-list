    "It was found that icedtea-web though 1.7.2 and 1.8.2 did not properly sanitize paths from \u003cjar/\u003e elements in JNLP files. An attacker could trick a victim into running a specially crafted application and use this flaw to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations in the context of the user.",
