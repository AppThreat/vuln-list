  "statement": "This bind flaw can be exploited by a remote attacker (AV:N). However the attack works only if the attacker could cause the bind server to perform queries on another DNS server and the other DNS server deliberately responds with malformed answers (AC:H). No other special privileges are required by the attacker (PR:L). No user interaction is required from the server side (UI:N). The attacker can cause denial of service (A:H) by causing the named process to exit with an assertion flaw. There is no affect on the Confidentiality or Integrity of the system (C:N/I:N).",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A race condition which may occur when discarding malformed packets can result in BIND exiting due to a REQUIRE assertion failure in dispatch.c. Versions affected: BIND 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.7, 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.12.4-P1, 9.14.0 -\u003e 9.14.2. Also all releases of the BIND 9.13 development branch and version 9.15.0 of the BIND 9.15 development branch and BIND Supported Preview Edition versions 9.11.3-S1 -\u003e 9.11.7-S1.",
    "A race condition leading to denial of service was found in the way bind handled certain malformed packets. A remote attacker who could cause the bind resolver to perform queries on a server, which responds deliberately with malformed answers, could cause named to exit."
