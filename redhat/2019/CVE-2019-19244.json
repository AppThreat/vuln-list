    "A flaw was found in the way SQLite handled certain types of SQL queries using DISTINCT, OVER and ORDER BY clauses. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a malicious SQL query that, when processed by an application linked to SQLite, would crash the application causing a denial of service."
