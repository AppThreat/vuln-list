    "An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. There is a NULL pointer dereference in the function cv::XMLParser::parse at modules/core/src/persistence.cpp.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenCV in the way the Cascade Classifier algorithm loaded and processed certain classifiers. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a specially crafted XML file that, when loaded by an application linked to OpenCV, would crash the application causing a denial of service."
