  "details": [
    "Exim 4.92 through 4.92.2 allows remote code execution, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-15846. There is a heap-based buffer overflow in string_vformat in string.c involving a long EHLO command.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Exim. The overflow can be triggered via specially crafted SMTP-protocol EHLO message, which may lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. It is thought that the execution of the remote code would be at the exim user level although execution as the root user cannot be ruled out."
