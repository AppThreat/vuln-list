    "A flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.1. An open redirect issue exists in URLs with a slash and backslash at the beginning.",
    "An open redirect flaw was discovered in mod_auth_openidc where it handles logout redirection. The module does not correctly validate the URL, allowing a URL with slash and backslash at the beginning to bypass the protection checks. A victim user may be tricked into visiting a trusted vulnerable web site, which would redirect him to another, possibly malicious, URL."
