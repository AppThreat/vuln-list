  "details": [
    "GNU Libc current is affected by: Re-mapping current loaded library with malicious ELF file. The impact is: In worst case attacker may evaluate privileges. The component is: libld. The attack vector is: Attacker sends 2 ELF files to victim and asks to run ldd on it. ldd execute code. NOTE: Upstream comments indicate \"this is being treated as a non-security bug and no real threat.",
    "It was discovered that when executing `ldd` on a malicious file, it is possible to execute code because of the way libraries are loaded into the process memory. An attacker may trick a victim user into running `ldd` on malicious files, thus executing code with their privileges."
