    "A heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in ImageMagick in the way it performs complex mathematics on an image sequence. Applications compiled against ImageMagick libraries that accept untrustworthy images may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image to make the application crash or leak application data."
