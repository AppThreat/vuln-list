    "A NULL pointer dereference was found in pkg/proxy/envoy/v2/debug.go getResourceVersion in Istio pilot before 1.5.0-alpha.0. If a particular HTTP GET request is made to the pilot API endpoint, it is possible to cause the Go runtime to panic (resulting in a denial of service to the istio-pilot application).",
    "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in istio-pilot. This flaw allows an attacker to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the pilot debug API endpoint. This action causes pilot to panic, resulting in a denial of service to the istio pilot application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
