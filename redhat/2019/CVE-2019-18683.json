  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in drivers/media/platform/vivid in the Linux kernel through 5.3.8. It is exploitable for privilege escalation on some Linux distributions where local users have /dev/video0 access, but only if the driver happens to be loaded. There are multiple race conditions during streaming stopping in this driver (part of the V4L2 subsystem). These issues are caused by wrong mutex locking in vivid_stop_generating_vid_cap(), vivid_stop_generating_vid_out(), sdr_cap_stop_streaming(), and the corresponding kthreads. At least one of these race conditions leads to a use-after-free.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Multiple race conditions were found in the vivid driver leading to privilege escalation and in at least one case a use-after-free condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
