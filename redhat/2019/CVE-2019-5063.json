  "details": [
    "An exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the data structure persistence functionality of OpenCV 4.1.0. A specially crafted XML file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in multiple heap corruptions and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability."
