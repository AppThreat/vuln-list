  "statement": "Impact of the flaw set to Moderate as restricted shell shall not be used as a security feature alone, as it is very hard to configure it properly and several bypasses exist for it.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of bash as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as they did not include support for BASH_CMDS environment variable.\nRed Hat Virtualization Hypervisor and Management Appliance were affected by this issue, but do not use the restricted bash shell in a way that would be exposed to attackers.  Future updates may address this issue.",
