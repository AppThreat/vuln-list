  "statement": "The vulnerability is rated Medium because no package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 6 and 7 is using Libntlm. Most 3rd party applications using Libntlm are command line clients and would be affected via a command line option or a configuration file, which are local vectors.",

  "name": "CVE-2019-17455",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Libntlm through 1.5 relies on a fixed buffer size for tSmbNtlmAuthRequest, tSmbNtlmAuthChallenge, and tSmbNtlmAuthResponse read and write operations, as demonstrated by a stack-based buffer over-read in buildSmbNtlmAuthRequest in smbutil.c for a crafted NTLM request.",
    "A flaw was found in the libntlm NTLM library where it was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the buildSmbNtlmAuthRequest_userlen() function. If an application using this library does not check input length before calling the function, an attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted request that could crash the application, or possibly trigger code execution."
