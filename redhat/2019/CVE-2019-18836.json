  "details": [
    "Envoy 1.12.0 allows a remote denial of service because of resource loops, as demonstrated by a single idle TCP connection being able to keep a worker thread in an infinite busy loop when continue_on_listener_filters_timeout is used.\"",
    "A flaw was found in envoy. When listeners are configured with `continue_on_listener_filters_timeout` true, an infinite busy loop is created if at least one connection is maintained on the loop. A remote attacker only needs to maintain one idle connection to consume one CPU core of the Envoy server, potentially leading to a denial of service attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
