  "statement": "This issue is present in the Broadcom Wi-Fi client devices firmware and is not fixable in software. While Red Hat ships certain hardware firmware binary blobs via linux-firmware package we rely on the hardware vendors to populate (and document) these firmware binary blobs with updated firmwares at their discretion. As a consequence, we are currently unable to tell whether current linux-firmware packages address this particular vulnerability.",

  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered on Broadcom Wi-Fi client devices. Specifically timed and handcrafted traffic can cause internal errors (related to state transitions) in a WLAN device that lead to improper layer 2 Wi-Fi encryption with a consequent possibility of information disclosure over the air for a discrete set of traffic, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9501, CVE-2019-9502, and CVE-2019-9503."
