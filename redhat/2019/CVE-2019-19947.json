    "In the Linux kernel through 5.4.6, there are information leaks of uninitialized memory to a USB device in the drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_leaf.c driver, aka CID-da2311a6385c.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions through 5.4.6, containing information leaks of uninitialized memory to a USB device. The latest findings show that the uninitialized memory allocation was not leading to an information leak, but was allocating the memory assigned with data on the next line and hence causing no violation."
