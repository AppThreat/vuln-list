  "details": [
    "Unbound before 1.9.5 allows configuration injection in create_unbound_ad_servers.sh upon a successful man-in-the-middle attack against a cleartext HTTP session. NOTE: The vendor does not consider this a vulnerability of the Unbound software. create_unbound_ad_servers.sh is a contributed script from the community that facilitates automatic configuration creation. It is not part of the Unbound installation",
    "A flaw was found in unbound. The create_unbound_ad_servers.sh bash script does not properly sanitize input data, which is retrieved using an unencrypted, unauthenticated HTTP request, before writing the configuration file allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity and system availability."
