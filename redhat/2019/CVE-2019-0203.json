  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Apache Subversion versions up to and including 1.9.10, 1.10.4, 1.12.0, Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when a client sends certain sequences of protocol commands. This can lead to disruption for users of the server.",
    "A flaw was found in subversion. A remote, unauthenticated user can cause a null-pointer-dereference in svnserve by sending a certain sequences of protocol commands to the server. This results in a denial of service in some server configurations, specifically when anonymous access is enabled. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
