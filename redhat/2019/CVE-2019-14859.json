  "statement": "Although Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships the flawed code, RHOSP does not actually use python-ecdsa's functionality. As such, Red Hat OpenStack Platform will not be providing a fix for python-ecdsa at this time.\nRed Hat CloudForms 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 is not affected as these versions no longer ship the python-ecdsa library. Only CloudForms 5.8, which is now EOL, delivered the python-ecdsa library.\nCurrent releases of Red Hat Virtualization Manager no longer include python-ecdsa as a dependency.  While it remains available in repositories as a legacy dependency, it is not installed by default and its use is not recommended.\nCurrent releases of Red Hat Satellite no longer include python-ecdsa as a dependency.  While it remains available in repositories as a legacy dependency, it is not installed by default and its use is not recommended.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in all python-ecdsa versions before 0.13.3, where it did not correctly verify whether signatures used DER encoding. Without this verification, a malformed signature could be accepted, making the signature malleable. Without proper verification, an attacker could use a malleable signature to create false transactions.",
