    "A cross-site request forgery vulnerability in Jenkins Ansible Tower Plugin 0.9.1 and earlier in the TowerInstallation.TowerInstallationDescriptor#doTestTowerConnection form validation method allowed attackers permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins",
    "A flaw was found in ansible-tower. Form validation methods allowed attackers permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins, leading to a cross-site request forgery vulnerability. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
