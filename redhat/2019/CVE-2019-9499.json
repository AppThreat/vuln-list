  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not include support for EAP-pwd.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they are not compiled with EAP-pwd enabled. In particular, the CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y option is not set at compile time.",

  "name": "CVE-2019-9499",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The implementations of EAP-PWD in wpa_supplicant EAP Peer, when built against a crypto library missing explicit validation on imported elements, do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. An attacker may complete authentication, session key and control of the data connection with a client. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.",
    "A flaw was found in wpa_supplicant. An attack using invalid scalar/element values is possible against the EAP-pwd peer since hostapd and wpa_supplicant did not validate these values in the received EAP-pwd-Commit messages.When processing an EAP-pwd Commit frame, the server's scalar and element (elliptic curve point) were not validated. This allowed an adversary to bypass authentication, and act as a rogue Access Point (AP) if the crypto implementation did not verify the validity of the EC point. The vulnerability is only exploitable if OpenSSL version 1.0.2 or lower is used, or if LibreSSL or wolfssl is used. Newer versions of OpenSSL (and also BoringSSL) implicitly validate the elliptic curve point in EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp(), preventing the attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."
