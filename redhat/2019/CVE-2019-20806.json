    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2. There is a NULL pointer dereference in tw5864_handle_frame() in drivers/media/pci/tw5864/tw5864-video.c, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-2e7682ebfc75.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in tw5864_handle_frame function in drivers/media/pci/tw5864/tw5864-video.c in the TW5864 Series Video media driver. The pointer 'vb' is assigned, but not validated before its use, and can lead to a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user or root privileges to crash the system or leak internal kernel information."
