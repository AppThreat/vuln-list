    "In the Linux kernel before 5.3.4, fib6_rule_lookup in net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c mishandles the RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF flag in a reference-count decision, leading to (for example) a crash that was identified by syzkaller, aka CID-7b09c2d052db.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel prior to version 5.3.4. Affected code was introduced in a recent patch of fib6_rule_lookup in net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c in the IPv6 subsystem of the kernel which was found to mishandle the RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF flag in a reference-count decision, leading to a crash. Availability is the highest threat from this vulnerability."
