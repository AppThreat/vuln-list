In most circumstances, the BTRFS kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any BTRFS filesystems are mounted or in use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",

    "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image and performing some operations can cause slab-out-of-bounds write access in __btrfs_map_block in fs/btrfs/volumes.c, because a value of 1 for the number of data stripes is mishandled.",
    "A flaw was found in the implementation of the BTRFS file system code in the Linux kernel. An attacker, who is able to mount a crafted BTRFS filesystem and perform common filesystem operations, can possibly cause an out-of-bounds write to memory. This could lead to memory corruption or privilege escalation."
