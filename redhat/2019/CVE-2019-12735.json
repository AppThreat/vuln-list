  "statement": "To be successfully and automatically triggered when a specially crafted file is opened, this vulnerability requires 3 parts :\n1) The `source!` command inability to check if it is running in sandbox mode (the fix commit prevents this)\n2) The `modeline` to be enabled (by default, modeline is disabled when running with root permission. See `Mitigation` steps to disable the modeline)\n3) A function, to be inserted in the modeline, that can be used to trigger the `source!` command (e.g.: `assert_fail()` in the public reproducer). To the best of our knowledge, no such functions were found in the default installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 5, 6 and 7 at the time of the flaw. However, Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 contains `assert_fail()`.\nWithout part 2 or 3, it would be required for an attacker to be able to craft the command line used to open the crafted file, in order to trigger the vulnerability.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim.",
    "It was found that the `:source!` command was not restricted by the sandbox mode. If modeline was explicitly enabled, opening a specially crafted text file in vim could result in arbitrary command execution."
