    "Arbitrary command execution is possible in Git before 2.20.2, 2.21.x before 2.21.1, 2.22.x before 2.22.2, 2.23.x before 2.23.1, and 2.24.x before 2.24.1 because a \"git submodule update\" operation can run commands found in the .gitmodules file of a malicious repository.",
    "A security bypass was discovered in git, which allows arbitrary commands to be executed during the update of git submodules. A remote attacker may trick a victim user into cloning a malicious repository that initially looks fine, allowing access to bypass the security mechanisms that prevent the execution of arbitrary commands during the submodule initialization. After following an update of the repository and the submodules done by the victim user, vulnerable versions of git may use the update setting in the .gitmodules file and execute arbitrary commands."
