  "mitigation": "The following methods can be used as a mitigation (only one is needed):\n1. Use the 'sharesec' tool to configure a security descriptor for the share that's at least as strict as the permissions on the share root  directory.\n2. Use the 'valid users' option to allow only users/groups which are able to enter the share root directory.\n3. Remove 'wide links = yes' if it's not really needed.\n4. In some situations it might be an option to use 'chmod a+x' on the share root directory, but you need to make sure that files and subdirectories are protected by stricter permissions. You may also want to 'chmod a-w' in order to prevent new top level files and directories, which may have less restrictive permissions.",
