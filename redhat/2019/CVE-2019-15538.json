  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of being out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This is primarily a local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS.",
    "A flaw was found in the XFS file system in the Linux kernel. An acquired ILOCK was not freed/unlock when the call to xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve fails and the lock is still held and can lead to denial to access for that device. This is primarily a local denial of service but could result in a remote denial of service if the XFS file system is exported as an NFS file system."
