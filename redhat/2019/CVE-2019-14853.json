As such, Red Hat OpenStack Platform will not be providing a fix for python-ecdsa at this time.\nCurrent releases of Red Hat Virtualization Manager no longer includes python-ecdsa as a dependency.  While it remains available in repositories as a legacy dependency, it is not installed by default and its use is not recommended.",
