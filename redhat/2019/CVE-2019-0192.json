    "In Apache Solr versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.5 and 6.0.0 to 6.6.5, the Config API allows to configure the JMX server via an HTTP POST request. By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the Solr side.",
    "A flaw was found in the Apache Solr's Config API, where it would permit the configuration of the JMX server via an HTTP POST request. An attacker could use this flaw to direct traffic to a malicious RMI server, and then trigger remote code execution or conduct further attacks."
