    "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the PDF export component of CloudForms, versions 5.9 and 5.10, due to user input is not properly sanitized. An attacker with least privilege to edit compute is able to execute a XSS attack against other users, which could lead to malicious code execution and extraction of the anti-CSRF token of higher privileged users.",
    "It was found that PDF export component in CloudForms was vulnerable to cross-side scripting (XSS) as user input was not properly sanitized. An authenticated attacker with privileges to edit compute could use the XSS vulnerability against users, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, and extraction of the anti-CSRF token of a higher privileged user."
