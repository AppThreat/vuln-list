  "details": [
    "An exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the data structure persistence functionality of OpenCV, before version 4.2.0. A specially crafted JSON file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in multiple heap corruptions and potentially code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability."
