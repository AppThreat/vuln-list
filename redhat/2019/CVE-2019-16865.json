    "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0. When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the library can either allocate very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to process the image.",
    "A flaw was discovered in the way the python-pillow may allocate a large amount of memory or require a long time while processing specially crafted image files, possibly causing a denial of service. Applications that use the library to process untrusted files may be vulnerable to this flaw."
