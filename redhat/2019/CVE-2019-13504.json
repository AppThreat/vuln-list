  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "There is an out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata in mrwimage.cpp in Exiv2 through 0.27.2.",
    "A vulnerability was found in exiv2. An integer wraparound could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way MemIo is implemented. Reading from the memory buffer with MemIo::Impl::read() reads data beyond the bufferâ€™s limits. An attacker could abuse this flaw by providing a specially crafted image that when read, would cause the application to crash or to leak sensitive data."
