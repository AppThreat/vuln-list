    "A heap-based buffer overflow in _cairo_image_surface_create_from_jpeg() in extensions/cairo_io/cairo-image-surface-jpeg.c in GNOME gThumb before 3.8.3 and Linux Mint Pix before 2.4.5 allows attackers to cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted JPEG file.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way gThumb rendered certain JPEG images. An attacker could use a specially crafted JPEG image to cause gThumb to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running gThumb."
