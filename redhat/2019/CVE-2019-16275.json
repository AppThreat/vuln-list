  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and 8. Versions of the package shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are built without AP mode (CONFIG_AP=y), while versions of the package shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8, even though they support AP mode, do not enable IEEE 802.11w (CONFIG_IEEE80211W=y). Both options are required for the flaw to be exploited.",

  "name": "CVE-2019-16275",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrect indication of disconnection in certain situations because source address validation is mishandled. This is a denial of service that should have been prevented by PMF (aka management frame protection). The attacker must send a crafted 802.11 frame from a location that is within the 802.11 communications range.",
    "A vulnerability was discovered in wpa_supplicant. When Access Point (AP) mode and Protected Management Frames (PMF) (IEEE 802.11w) are enabled, wpa_supplicant does not perform enough validation on the source address of some received management frames. An attacker within the 802.11 communications range could use this flaw to inject an unauthenticated frame and perform a denial-of-service attack against another device which would be disconnected from the network."
