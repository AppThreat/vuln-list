    "A heap-based buffer overflow in the vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov function in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through 0.8.0 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service, or QEMU guest-to-host escape and code execution, via VIRGL_CCMD_RESOURCE_INLINE_WRITE commands.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in virglrenderer. The vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov function allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service or a QEMU guest-to-host escape with code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as to system availability."
