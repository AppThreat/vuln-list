  "mitigation": "As the rio500 module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"blacklist rio500\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/rio-500.conf \n# echo \"install rio500 /bin/false\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/rio-500.conf  \nThe system will need to be restarted if the RIO500 modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any devices or programs are using the USB device.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",

    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.1.8. There is a double-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the RIO500 driver in the Linux kernel. The implementation of the driver did not consider that multiple RIO500 devices could be attached to the same system, simultaneously. When a second device connects, the system overwrites the data structures in use by the first allowing a local attacker to possibly create a use-after-free situation which can lead to memory corruption, system panic, or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability, although data integrity is also at risk as well."
