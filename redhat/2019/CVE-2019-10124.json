    "This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority for the following reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none",
    "A bug was discovered in the hwpoison implementation in mm/memory-failure.c in the Linux kernel. When soft_offline_in_use_page() is run for a thp tail page after pmd is split, a privileged attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS). Privileged access is required for an attacker to trigger this bug, thus, we believe this bug is not a security flaw."
