  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was discovered in Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, iOS, and Android that allows a malicious access point, or an adjacent user, to determine if a connected user is using a VPN, make positive inferences about the websites they are visiting, and determine the correct sequence and acknowledgement numbers in use, allowing the bad actor to inject data into the TCP stream. This provides everything that is needed for an attacker to hijack active connections inside the VPN tunnel.",
    "A flaw was found in openvpn. A malicous access point or adjacent user can determine if a connected user is using a VPN by making positive inferences about the websites they are visiting, and determining the correct sequence and acknowledgement numbers in use, which allows the attacker to inject data into the TCP stream. With this information, an attacker could hijack an active connection inside the VPN tunnel. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
