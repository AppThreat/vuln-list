  "statement": "* The exploitation of this flaw depends on the use of either Sumo Logic or Splunk callback plugins. However, because Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) does not use Sumo Logic or Splunk, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for RHOSP Ansible at this time.\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage no more maintains its own version of Ansible, pre-requisite is to enable ansible repository. The fix will be consumed from core Ansible.\n* Ansible Tower’s Splunk logging integration uses the Splunk HTTP Collector and Ansible Engine.\n* The exploitation of this flaw depends on the use of either Sumo Logic or Splunk callback plugins. However, because Red Hat Satellite 6.4 and 6.5 do not use Sumo Logic or Splunk, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for Satellite 6.4 and 6.5 and Ansible at this time. Users may upgrade to Satellite 6.6 or later which includes the resolution to this bug if desired.",

This would discloses and collects any sensitive data.",
    "A data disclosure flaw was found in Ansible when using the Splunk and Sumologic modules, as they are not respecting when the flag no_log is enabled. This flaw can disclose and collect sensitive data from the system and expose it to an attacker."
