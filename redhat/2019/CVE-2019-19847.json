  "details": [
    "Libspiro through 20190731 has a stack-based buffer overflow in the spiro_to_bpath0() function in spiro.c.",
    "An off-by-one vulnerability was found in libspiro in the way a double array is first declared in a unit test and then accessed by the library itself. Applications that make use of libspiro in the same way as the example code in the test suite may be vulnerable to this flaw. A remote attacker could abuse this flaw to make the application crash or potentially execute arbitrary code."
