Additionally, updates for this package are received through the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repository.\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses only the openwsman-python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman.\nThis issue affects the versions of openwsman as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
