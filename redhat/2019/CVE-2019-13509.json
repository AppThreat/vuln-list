  "statement": "This issue does affect the versions of docker as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, however debug mode on the daemon needs to be explicitly enabled as the docker systemd service, by default, does not enable debug mode.\nRed Hat Fuse provides only the Docker client library and is not affected by this vulnerability.",

  "name": "CVE-2019-13509",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log. This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack API if they resend the secret."
