  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Docker 19.03.x before 19.03.1 linked against the GNU C Library (aka glibc), code injection can occur when the nsswitch facility dynamically loads a library inside a chroot that contains the contents of the container.",
    "A flaw was discovered in Docker if it is compiled with Go 1.11. During a `docker cp` command, the nsswitch facility dynamically loads a library inside a chroot that contains the contents of the container. An attacker could abuse this flaw by executing code with the root privileges."
