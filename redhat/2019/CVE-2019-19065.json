  "details": [
    "A memory leak in the sdma_init() function in drivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/sdma.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering rhashtable_init() failures, aka CID-34b3be18a04e. NOTE: This has been disputed as not a vulnerability because \"rhashtable_init() can only fail if it is passed invalid values in the second parameter's struct, but when invoked from sdma_init() that is a pointer to a static const struct, so an attacker could only trigger failure if they could corrupt kernel memory (in which case a small memory leak is not a significant problem).",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Intel OPA Gen1 driver mishandles resource cleanup. An attacker able to induce low memory condition on the system could use this flaw to crash the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
