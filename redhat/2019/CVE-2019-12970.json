  "details": [
    "XSS was discovered in SquirrelMail through 1.4.22 and 1.5.x through 1.5.2. Due to improper handling of RCDATA and RAWTEXT type elements, the built-in sanitization mechanism can be bypassed. Malicious script content from HTML e-mail can be executed within the application context via crafted use of (for example) a NOEMBED, NOFRAMES, NOSCRIPT, or TEXTAREA element."
