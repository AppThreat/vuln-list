  "details": [
    "Flatpak before 1.0.7, and 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.3, exposes /proc in the apply_extra script sandbox, which allows attackers to modify a host-side executable file.",
    "A flaw was found in flatpak. In certain special cases, installing flatpak applications and runtimes system-wide may allow an attacker to escape the flatpak sandbox. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
