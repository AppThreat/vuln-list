  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free (read) in the debugfs_remove function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is used to remove a file or directory in debugfs that was previously created with a call to another debugfs function such as debugfs_create_file). NOTE: Linux kernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs, instead this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the debugfs_remove function in the Linux kernel. The flaw could allow a local attacker with special user (or root) privilege to crash the system at the time of file or directory removal. This vulnerability can lead to a kernel information leak. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
