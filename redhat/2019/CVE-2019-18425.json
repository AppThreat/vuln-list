  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OS users to gain guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors. There is missing descriptor table limit checking in x86 PV emulation. When emulating certain PV guest operations, descriptor table accesses are performed by the emulating code. Such accesses should respect the guest specified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case. Without this, emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates would allow guest user mode to install and then use descriptors of their choice, as long as the guest kernel did not itself install an LDT. (Most OSes don't install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user mode can elevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage this vulnerability. HVM, PVH, as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability. Arm systems are unaffected.",
    "A flaw was in Xen. Guest specified limits for descriptor table access, during PV guest operations, were found to not be enforced. An attacker with the ability to emulate 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates, would be allowed to install and then use descriptors of their choice as long as the guest kernel did not, itself, install an LDT. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
