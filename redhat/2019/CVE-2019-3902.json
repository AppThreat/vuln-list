  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Mercurial before 4.9. It was possible to use symlinks and subrepositories to defeat Mercurial's path-checking logic and write files outside a repository.",
    "Starting with version 1.5.3, Mercurial allows environment variable expansion on path names for sub repositories when creating it or cloning a parent repository, but it doesn't validate whether the final path name outside the repository root directory. An attacker can leverage this weakness using a combination of symbolic links and environment variables to craft a tampered repository, leading Mercurial to write files outside the repository as long the destination location is empty."
