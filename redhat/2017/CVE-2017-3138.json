  "details": [
    "named contains a feature which allows operators to issue commands to a running server by communicating with the server process over a control channel, using a utility program such as rndc. A regression introduced in a recent feature change has created a situation under which some versions of named can be caused to exit with a REQUIRE assertion failure if they are sent a null command string. Affects BIND 9.9.9-\u003e9.9.9-P7, 9.9.10b1-\u003e9.9.10rc2, 9.10.4-\u003e9.10.4-P7, 9.10.5b1-\u003e9.10.5rc2, 9.11.0-\u003e9.11.0-P4, 9.11.1b1-\u003e9.11.1rc2, 9.9.9-S1-\u003e9.9.9-S9.",
    "A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND processed control channel commands. A remote attacker with access to the BIND control channel could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted command."
