    "In Irssi before 1.0.3, when receiving a DCC message without source nick/host, it attempts to dereference a NULL pointer. Thus, remote IRC servers can cause a crash.",
    "A null pointer dereference was found in the way irssi handles DCC messages that do not contain a source nick/host. A malicious IRC server could be used to crash an irssi client by sending a specially crafted DCC message."
