    "plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_crypto_openssl.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.15.2 mishandles Distinguished Name (DN) fields, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) in situations involving untrusted X.509 data, related to the get_matching_data and X509_NAME_oneline_ex functions. NOTE: this has security relevance only in use cases outside of the MIT Kerberos distribution, e.g., the use of get_matching_data in KDC certauth plugin code that is specific to Red Hat.",
    "A stack based buffer overflow was found in the get_matching_data() function, when reading the principal's certificate during pkinit preauthentication. If the Certifcate Authority's subject line is sufficiently long, an attacker able to have a specially crafted certificate signed could crash the authentication process, such as kinit, or, possibly, run arbitrary code."
