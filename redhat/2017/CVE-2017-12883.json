    "Buffer overflow in the S_grok_bslash_N function in regcomp.c in Perl 5 before 5.24.3-RC1 and 5.26.x before 5.26.1-RC1 allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted regular expression with an invalid '\\N{U+...}' escape.",
    "A heap buffer overread was found in perl's grok_bslash_N() function, which is used in the compilation of Unicode nodes in regular expressions, possibly leading to crash or dump of memory segments via the error output. An attacker, able to provide a specially crafted regular expression, could look for sensible information in the error message, or crash perl."
