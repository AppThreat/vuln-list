The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. Run the following commands to blacklist the ISDN module, thus preventing them from loading:\n```# echo \"install isdn /bin/true\"\u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-isdn.conf```\nOn RHEL 6 execute the following commands as root to check if any isdn-related services are present:\n```# chkconfig --list | grep isdn```\nand disable them if they are:\n```#  chkconfig isdn off```\n(or use a name of another isdn-related service)",

    "In /drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c: A user-controlled buffer is copied into a local buffer of constant size using strcpy without a length check which can cause a buffer overflow. This affects the Linux kernel 4.9-stable tree, 4.12-stable tree, 3.18-stable tree, and 4.4-stable tree.",
