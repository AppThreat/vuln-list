This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of this product due to its life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\nThis issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 may address this issue.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.5 is vulnerable to a data race in the ALSA /dev/snd/timer driver resulting in local users being able to read information belonging to other users, i.e., uninitialized memory contents may be disclosed when a read and an ioctl happen at the same time.",
    "It was found that the timer functionality in the Linux kernel ALSA subsystem is prone to a race condition between read and ioctl system call handlers, resulting in an uninitialized memory disclosure to user space. A local user could use this flaw to read information belonging to other users."
