  "details": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow in the loadbuf function in formisc.c in formail in procmail 3.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted e-mail message because of a hardcoded realloc size, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-3618.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in procmail's formail utility. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted email that, when processed by formail, could cause formail to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running formail."
