  "details": [
    "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the Databook loading functionality of Tablib 0.11.4. A yaml loaded Databook can execute arbitrary python commands resulting in command execution. An attacker can insert python into loaded yaml to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "It was found that loading a yaml format Databook from an untrusted source could lead to arbitrary code execution in python-tablib as the safe_load method was not used to load the content."
