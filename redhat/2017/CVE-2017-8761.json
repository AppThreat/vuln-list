  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In OpenStack Swift through 2.10.1, 2.11.0 through 2.13.0, and 2.14.0, the proxy-server logs full tempurl paths, potentially leaking reusable tempurl signatures to anyone with read access to these logs. All Swift deployments using the tempurl middleware are affected.",
    "A flaw was found in openstack-swift, where the proxy server logs valid temporary URLs, that might be used to gain access to data by anyone with access to the logfiles. This is especially important with tempurls that are valid for extended periods or when using central logging servers, accessed by operators that have no access to the Swift servers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
