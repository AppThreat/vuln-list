  "details": [
    "The sctp_v6_create_accept_sk function in net/sctp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel through 4.11.1 mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to CVE-2017-8890.",
    "The sctp_v6_create_accept_sk function in net/sctp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to CVE-2017-8890. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
