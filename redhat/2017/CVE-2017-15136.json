  "details": [
    "When registering and activating a new system with Red Hat Satellite 6 if the new systems hostname is then reset to the hostname of a previously registered system the previously registered system will lose access to updates including security updates.",
    "When registering a system with Satellite 6 a hostname must be specified. if an additional system is registered with the same hostname, the original system will stop receiving updates from Satellite 6. An attacker with administrative privileges to add systems to a Satellite 6 server could exploit this to prevent other hosts from getting security updates."
