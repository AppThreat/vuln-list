  "details": [
    "A global buffer overflow in OptiPNG 0.7.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service attack or other unspecified impact with a maliciously crafted GIF format file, related to an uncontrolled loop in the LZWReadByte function of the gifread.c file.",
    "An invalid memory write flaw was found in the way OptiPNG handles processing of GIF files. This flaw could potentially be used to crash the OptiPNG program by tricking it into processing crafted GIF files."
