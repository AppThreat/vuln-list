  "details": [
    "In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially malformed repository can cause Git subrepositories to run arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script checked into the repository. Typical use of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories, but they can be created programmatically.",
    "It was found that mercurial was vulnerable to cross repositories modification. A specially crafted mercurial repository could trigger arbitrary commands on a client during commands such as clone or update."
