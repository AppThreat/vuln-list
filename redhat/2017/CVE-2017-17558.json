This is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of the product due to its life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\nThis issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, its real-time kernel, Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9 LE. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases may address this issue.",

    "The usb_destroy_configuration function in drivers/usb/core/config.c in the USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.14.5 does not consider the maximum number of configurations and interfaces before attempting to release resources, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.",
    "The usb_destroy_configuration() function, in 'drivers/usb/core/config.c' in the USB core subsystem, in the Linux kernel through 4.14.5 does not consider the maximum number of configurations and interfaces before attempting to release resources. This allows local users to cause a denial of service, due to out-of-bounds write access, or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
