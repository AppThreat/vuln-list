  "details": [
    "It was found that system umask policy is not being honored when creating XDG user directories, since Xsession sources xdg-user-dirs.sh before setting umask policy. This only affects xdg-user-dirs before 0.15.5 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",
    "It was found that the system umask policy is not being honored when creating XDG user directories (~/Desktop etc) on first login. This could lead to user's files being inadvertently exposed to other local users."
