  "statement": "The security assessment from cure53 clarifies that this issue (identified as NTP-01-0004) is not a vulnerability per se, but a weakness in ntp's internal coding style that may cause a vulnerability if particularly long variable names are defined at compile time.

  "details": [
    "Multiple buffer overflows in the ctl_put* functions in NTP before 4.2.8p10 and 4.3.x before 4.3.94 allow remote authenticated users to have unspecified impact via a long variable.",
    "A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the building of response packets with custom fields. If custom fields were configured in ntp.conf with particularly long names, inclusion of these fields in the response packet could cause a buffer overflow, leading to a crash."
