  "details": [
    "The daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, does not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames found in \"xname follows\" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function in rsync.c), which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions."
