  "details": [
    "There is a heap based buffer overflow in tools/tiff2pdf.c of LibTIFF 4.0.8 via a PlanarConfig=Contig image, which causes a more than one hundred bytes out-of-bounds write (related to the ZIPDecode function in tif_zip.c). A crafted input may lead to a remote denial of service attack or an arbitrary code execution attack.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found within libtiff's tiff2pdf tool. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into converting a specially crafted file using the tiff2pdf tool."
