  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.7 does not validate certain levels data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via a crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device.",
    "In the Linux kernel's vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl() function, in 'drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c' file, a 'req-\u003emip_levels' is a user-controlled value which is later used as a loop count limit. This allows local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service by a kernel lockup via a crafted ioctl call for a '/dev/dri/renderD*' device."
