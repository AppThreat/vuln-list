  "details": [
    "The parse_char_class function in regparse.c in the Onigmo (aka Oniguruma-mod) regular expression library, as used in Ruby 2.4.0, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (deep recursion and application crash) via a crafted regular expression.",
    "An unbounded recursion flaw was found in the way Ruby handled regular expressions. A specially crafted regular expression could be used by an attacker to crash an Ruby application processing such crafted input."
