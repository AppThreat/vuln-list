  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The default whitelist included the following unsafe entries: DefaultGroovyMethods.putAt(Object, String, Object); DefaultGroovyMethods.getAt(Object, String). These allowed circumventing many of the access restrictions implemented in the script sandbox by using e.g. currentBuild['rawBuild'] rather than currentBuild.rawBuild. Additionally, the following entries allowed accessing private data that would not be accessible otherwise due to script security: groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Closure); groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Object).",
    "The jenkins-plugin-script-security improperly whitelisted \"DefaultGroovyMethods.putAt(Object, String, Object)\" and \"DefaultGroovyMethods.getAt(Object, String)\" which allows attackers to bypass many restrictions and potentially trigger builds or access data they should not have access to. Exploitation of this requires the attacker to have access to the Jenkins instance, and for that Jenkins instance to be hosting other projects as well that the attacker should not have access to."
