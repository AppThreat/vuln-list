  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Exiv2 0.26, there is an integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer over-read in the Exiv2::getULong function in types.cpp. Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted image file. Note that this vulnerability is different from CVE-2017-14864, which is an invalid memory address dereference.",
    "An integer wraparound, leading to heap-based out-of-bound read, was found in the way Exiv2 library reads ICC profiles embedded in a JP2 image. By persuading a victim to open a crafted JP2 image, a remote attacker could crash the application or possibly retrieve a portion of memory."
