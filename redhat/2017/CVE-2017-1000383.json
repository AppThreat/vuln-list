  "details": [
    "GNU Emacs version 25.3.1 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a backup save file (\"[ORIGINAL_FILENAME]~\") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the emacs binary.",
    "It was found that emacs applies the opened file read permissions to the swap file, overriding the process' umask. An attacker might search for vim swap files, that were not deleted properly, in order to retrieve sensible data."
