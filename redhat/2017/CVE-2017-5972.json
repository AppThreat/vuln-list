  "statement": "This issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,6, 7 and MRG-2 kernels.  Red Hat has no plans to fix this issue at this time.\nWhile performance enhancements have been made upstream, Red Hat Product Security believes the report to be invalid and able to be mitigated with synproxy.  This flaw is currently under investigation for validity and Red Hat is asking to revoke the CVE.",

  "name": "CVE-2017-5972",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c attack code."
