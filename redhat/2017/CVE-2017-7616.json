This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 on ppc64 and ppc64le platforms. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases might address this issue.\nOnly ppc64 and ppc64le hardware platforms are vulnerable. The Linux kernel packages for other platforms which Red Hat ships (i386, x86_64, s390x) are not vulnerable to this security flaw.\nThis issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux MRG-2 as this product is shipped for x86_64 hardware platform only.",
