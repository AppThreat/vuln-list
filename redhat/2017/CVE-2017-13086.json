    "Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) allows reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) Peer Key (TPK) during the TDLS handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames.",
    "A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) Peerkey (TPK) key during a TDLS handshake."
