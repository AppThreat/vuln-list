  "mitigation": "Red Hat recommends blacklisting the kernel module to prevent its use. This will prevent accidental version loading by administration and also mitigate the flaw if a kernel with the affected module is booted.\nAs the macsec module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\nRaw\n# echo \"install macsec /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-macsec.conf \nIf macsec functionality is in use as a functional part of the system a kernel upgrade is required.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow in drivers/net/macsec.c in the MACsec module in the Linux kernel through 4.10.12 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the use of a MAX_SKB_FRAGS+1 size in conjunction with the NETIF_F_FRAGLIST feature, leading to an error in the skb_to_sgvec function.",
    "A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel allocates heap memory to build the scattergather list from a fragment list(skb_shinfo(skb)-\u003efrag_list) in the socket buffer(skb_buff). The heap overflow occurred if 'MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1' parameter and 'NETIF_F_FRAGLIST' feature are both used together. A remote user or process could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privilege on a system."
