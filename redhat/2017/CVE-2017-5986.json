  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Race condition in the sctp_wait_for_sndbuf function in net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and panic) via a multithreaded application that peels off an association in a certain buffer-full state.",
    "It was reported that with Linux kernel, earlier than version v4.10-rc8, an application may trigger a BUG_ON in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is waiting on it to queue more data, and meanwhile another thread peels off the association being used by the first thread."
