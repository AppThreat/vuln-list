  "details": [
    "The ip6gre_err function in net/ipv6/ip6_gre.c in the Linux kernel allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving GRE flags in an IPv6 packet, which trigger an out-of-bounds access.",
    "An issue was found in the Linux kernel ipv6 implementation of GRE tunnels which allows a remote attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds access.  At this time we understand no trust barrier has been crossed and there is no security implications in this flaw."
