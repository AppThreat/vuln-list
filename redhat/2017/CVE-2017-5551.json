  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The simple_set_acl function in fs/posix_acl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.6 preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call involving a tmpfs filesystem, which allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-7097.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in 'tmpfs' file system. When file permissions are modified via 'chmod' and the user is not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in inode_change_ok(). Setting a POSIX ACL via 'setxattr' sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in 'chmod'."
