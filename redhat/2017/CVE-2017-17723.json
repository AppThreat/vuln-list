  "details": [
    "In Exiv2 0.26, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the Exiv2::Image::byteSwap4 function in image.cpp. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to disclose memory data or cause a denial of service via a crafted TIFF file.",
    "An integer wraparound, leading to heap-based out-of-bound read, was found in the way Exiv2 library prints Image File Directory(IFD) in TIFF images. By persuading a victim to open a crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could crash the application or possibly retrieve a portion of memory."
