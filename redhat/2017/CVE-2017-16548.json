    "The receive_xattr function in xattrs.c in rsync 3.1.2 and 3.1.3-development does not check for a trailing '\\0' character in an xattr name, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by sending crafted data to the daemon."
