  "mitigation": "This issue requires rogue PCI device to be planted on the system. Once such rogue PCI device is successfully planted however, attacker has usually more options for hostile takeover than just exploiting this issue. To mitigate this issue restrict physical access to your systems to only approved personnel (and generally follow general physical security guidelines) and do not use/insert into system PCI devices with unknown origin.",
