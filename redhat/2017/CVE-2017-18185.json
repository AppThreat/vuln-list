    "An issue was discovered in QPDF before 7.0.0. There is a large heap-based out-of-bounds read in the Pl_Buffer::write function in Pl_Buffer.cc. It is caused by an integer overflow in the PNG filter.",
    "An integer overflow flaw leading to heap-based out-of-bounds read was found in the way QPDF parsed PDF files. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash QPDF by tricking it into processing crafted QPDF files."
