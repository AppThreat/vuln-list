    "In Xiph.Org libvorbis 1.3.5, an out-of-bounds array read vulnerability exists in the function mapping0_forward() in mapping0.c, which may lead to DoS when operating on a crafted audio file with vorbis_analysis().",
    "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way libvorbis handled processing of Ogg Vorbis format files. This flaw could potentially be used to crash an application using libvorbis by tricking the application into processing specially crafted files."
