    "Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) allows reinstallation of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) Temporal Key (TK) during the four-way handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames.",
    "A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used pairwise key (PTK-TK) during a 4-way handshake."
