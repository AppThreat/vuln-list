  "details": [
    "The IPv6 fragmentation implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.11.1 does not consider that the nexthdr field may be associated with an invalid option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and BUG) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted socket and send system calls.",
    "The IPv6 fragmentation implementation in the Linux kernel does not consider that the nexthdr field may be associated with an invalid option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and BUG) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted socket and send system calls. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
