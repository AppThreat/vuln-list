  "details": [
    "If named is configured to use Response Policy Zones (RPZ) an error processing some rule types can lead to a condition where BIND will endlessly loop while handling a query. Affects BIND 9.9.10, 9.10.5, 9.11.0-\u003e9.11.1, 9.9.10-S1, 9.10.5-S1.",
    "A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled processing of NSDNAME and NSIP rules. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named enter an infinite loop by sending a specially crafted query, thus resulting in denial-of-service."
