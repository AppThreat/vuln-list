    "Docker Registry before 2.6.2 in Docker Distribution does not properly restrict the amount of content accepted from a user, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via the manifest endpoint.",
    "It was found that docker-distribution did not properly restrict memory allocation size for a registry instance through the manifest endpoint. An attacker could send a specially crafted request that would exhaust the memory of the docker-distribution service."
