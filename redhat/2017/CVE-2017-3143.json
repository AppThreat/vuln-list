    "An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update. Affects BIND 9.4.0-\u003e9.8.8, 9.9.0-\u003e9.9.10-P1, 9.10.0-\u003e9.10.5-P1, 9.11.0-\u003e9.11.1-P1, 9.9.3-S1-\u003e9.9.10-S2, 9.10.5-S1-\u003e9.10.5-S2.",
    "A flaw was found in the way BIND handled TSIG authentication for dynamic updates. A remote attacker able to communicate with an authoritative BIND server could use this flaw to manipulate the contents of a zone, by forging a valid TSIG or SIG(0) signature for a dynamic update request."
