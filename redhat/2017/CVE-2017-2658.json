    "It was discovered that the Dashbuilder login page as used in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite before 6.4.2 and Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization \u0026 Services before 6.4.3 could be opened in an IFRAME, which made it possible to intercept and manipulate requests. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into performing arbitrary actions in the Console (clickjacking).",
