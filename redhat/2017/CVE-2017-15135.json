    "It was found that 389-ds-base since 1.3.6.1 up to and including 1.4.0.3 did not always handle internal hash comparison operations correctly during the authentication process. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to bypass the authentication process under very rare and specific circumstances.",
