  "details": [
    "Vulnerability in the MySQL Connectors component of Oracle MySQL (subcomponent: Connector/J). Supported versions that are affected are 5.1.40 and earlier. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Connectors. While the vulnerability is in MySQL Connectors, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of MySQL Connectors. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).",
    "It was discovered that the MySQL Connector/J client could deserialize certain database contents, regardless of the \"autoDeserialize\" option. If the client processes data received from an untrusted or compromised database server, a remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause remote code execution."
