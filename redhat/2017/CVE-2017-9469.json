  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Irssi before 1.0.3, when receiving certain incorrectly quoted DCC files, it tries to find the terminating quote one byte before the allocated memory. Thus, remote attackers might be able to cause a crash.",
    "An out-of-bound heap read was found in irssi's get_file_params_count() function, during the parsing of a DCC SEND request. An IRC client connected to the same IRC network as the target could send a specially crafted request that would force irssi to read 1 byte outside of an allocated string, which could, possibly, lead to an invalid memory read."
