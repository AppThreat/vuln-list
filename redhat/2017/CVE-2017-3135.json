    "Under some conditions when using both DNS64 and RPZ to rewrite query responses, query processing can resume in an inconsistent state leading to either an INSIST assertion failure or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer.

    "A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled query responses when both DNS64 and RPZ were used. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure or a null pointer dereference via a specially crafted DNS response."
