  "details": [
    "The klsi_105_get_line_state function in drivers/usb/serial/kl5kusb105.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 places uninitialized heap-memory contents into a log entry upon a failure to read the line status, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log.",
    "It was found that current implementation of kl5kusb105 driver failed to detect short transfers when attempting to read the line state and logged the content of the uninitialized heap transfer buffer."
