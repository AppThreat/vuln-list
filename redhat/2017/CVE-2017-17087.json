  "details": [
    "fileio.c in Vim prior to 8.0.1263 sets the group ownership of a .swp file to the editor's primary group (which may be different from the group ownership of the original file), which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging an applicable group membership, as demonstrated by /etc/shadow owned by root:shadow mode 0640, but /etc/.shadow.swp owned by root:users mode 0640, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-1000382.",
    "It was found that the swap file created by vim when opening a file was using the user's primary group instead of the file's group. An attacker belonging to the victim's primary group could use this flaw to read the vim swap file."
