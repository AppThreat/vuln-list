    "In Exiv2 0.26, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the Exiv2::IptcData::printStructure function in iptc.cpp, related to the \"!= 0x1c\" case. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted TIFF file.",
    "An integer underflow, leading to heap-based out-of-bound read, was found in the way Exiv2 library prints IPTC Photo Metadata embedded in an image. By persuading a victim to open a crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application or possibly retrieve a portion of memory."
