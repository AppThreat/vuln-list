  "details": [
    "NGINX before 1.13.6 has a buffer overflow for years that exceed four digits, as demonstrated by a file with a modification date in 1969 that causes an integer overflow (or a false modification date far in the future), when encountered by the autoindex module.",
    "A flaw was found in nginx. When a date exists earlier than the standard epoch, as demonstrated by a file with a modification date in 1969 that causes a negative number to be treated as an unsigned integer, the year field becomes five characters long, larger than is allocated for, leading to a buffer overflow.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
