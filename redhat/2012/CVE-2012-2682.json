  "details": [
    "Cumin (aka MRG Management Console), as used in Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5, allows attackers with certain database privileges to cause a denial of service (inaccessible page) via a non-ASCII character in the name of a link.",
    "It was found that if Cumin were asked to display a link name containing non-ASCII characters, the request would terminate with an error. If data containing non-ASCII characters were added to the database (such as via Cumin or Wallaby), requests to load said data would terminate and the requested page would not be displayed until an administrator cleans the database."
