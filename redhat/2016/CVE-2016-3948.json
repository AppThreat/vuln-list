  "details": [
    "Squid 3.x before 3.5.16 and 4.x before 4.0.8 improperly perform bounds checking, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted HTTP response, related to Vary headers.",
    "An incorrect boundary check was found in the way squid handled the Vary header in HTTP responses, which could lead to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response."
