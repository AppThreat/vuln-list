    "slapd/connection.c in 389 Directory Server (formerly Fedora Directory Server) 1.3.4.x before 1.3.4.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and connection blocking) by leveraging an abnormally closed connection.",
    "An infinite-loop vulnerability was discovered in the 389 directory server, where the server failed to correctly handle unexpectedly closed client connections. A remote attacker able to connect to the server could use this flaw to make the directory server consume an excessive amount of CPU and stop accepting connections (denial of service)."
