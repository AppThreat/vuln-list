  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "libcontainer/user/user.go in runC before 0.1.0, as used in Docker before 1.11.2, improperly treats a numeric UID as a potential username, which allows local users to gain privileges via a numeric username in the password file in a container.",
    "It was found that Docker would launch containers under the specified UID instead of a username. An attacker able to launch a container could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root within the launched container."
