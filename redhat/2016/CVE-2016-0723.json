  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Race condition in the tty_ioctl function in drivers/tty/tty_io.c in the Linux kernel through 4.4.1 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) by making a TIOCGETD ioctl call during processing of a TIOCSETD ioctl call.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's tty subsystem, which allows for the disclosure of uncontrolled memory location and possible kernel panic. The information leak is caused by a race condition when attempting to set and read the tty line discipline.  A local attacker could use the TIOCSETD (via tty_set_ldisc) to switch to a new line discipline; a concurrent call to a TIOCGETD ioctl performing a read on a given tty could then access previously allocated memory.  Up to 4 bytes could be leaked when querying the line discipline or the kernel could panic with a NULL-pointer dereference."
