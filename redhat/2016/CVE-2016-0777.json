  "mitigation": "1. The vulnerable roaming code can be permanently disabled by adding the\nundocumented option \"UseRoaming no\" to the system-wide configuration\nfile (usually /etc/ssh/ssh_config), or per-user configuration file\n(~/.ssh/config), or command-line (-o \"UseRoaming no\").\n2. If an OpenSSH client is disconnected from an SSH server that offers\nroaming, it prints \"[connection suspended, press return to resume]\" on\nstderr, and waits for '\\n' or '\\r' on stdin (and not on the controlling\nterminal) before it reconnects to the server; advanced users may become\nsuspicious and press Control-C or Control-Z instead, thus avoiding the\ninformation leak.\nHowever, SSH commands that use the local stdin to transfer data to the\nremote server are bound to trigger this reconnection automatically (upon\nreading a '\\n' or '\\r' from stdin). Moreover, these non-interactive SSH\ncommands (for example, backup scripts and cron jobs) commonly employ\npublic-key authentication and are therefore perfect targets for this\ninformation leak.",
