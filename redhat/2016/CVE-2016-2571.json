  "details": [
    "http.cc in Squid 3.x before 3.5.15 and 4.x before 4.0.7 proceeds with the storage of certain data after a response-parsing failure, which allows remote HTTP servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed response.",
    "It was found that squid did not properly handle errors when failing to parse an HTTP response, possibly leading to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response."
