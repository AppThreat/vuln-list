  "name": "CVE-2016-4578",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6 does not initialize certain r1 data structures, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via crafted use of the ALSA timer interface, related to the (1) snd_timer_user_ccallback and (2) snd_timer_user_tinterrupt functions.",
    "A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel. There is an information leak in file sound/core/timer.c of the latest mainline Linux kernel. The stack object “r1” has a total size of 32 bytes. Its field “event” and “val” both contain 4 bytes padding. These 8 bytes padding bytes are sent to user without being initialized."
