  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The web interface in Red Hat QuickStart Cloud Installer (QCI) 1.0 does not mask passwords fields, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive password information by reading the display.",
    "It was found that several password fields in QCI failed to properly mask the password while it was being entered. An attacker with physical access or the ability to view the screen would be able to see the passwords as they are being entered, allowing them to later access accounts and services protected by those passwords."
