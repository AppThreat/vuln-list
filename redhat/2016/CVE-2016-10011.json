  "statement": "It seems that this flaw is not practically exploitable, the leak of host private key material to the privilege-separated child processes is theoretical. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys, nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material to unprivileged users. Because of the this restriction for successful exploitation, this issue has been rated as having Low security impact. A future update may address this flaw.",

  "name": "CVE-2016-10011",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "authfile.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not properly consider the effects of realloc on buffer contents, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive private-key information by leveraging access to a privilege-separated child process.",
    "It was found that the host private key material could possibly leak to the privilege-separated child processes via re-allocated memory. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could therefore obtain the leaked key information."
