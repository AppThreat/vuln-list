  "details": [
    "Multiple integer overflows in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data that is mishandled during opj_aligned_malloc calls in dwt.c and t1.c.",
    "An integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow, was found in openjpeg, also affecting the PDF viewer in Chromium. A specially crafted JPEG2000 image could cause an incorrect calculation when allocating memory for code blocks, which could lead to a crash, or potentially, code execution."
