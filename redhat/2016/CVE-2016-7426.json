  "details": [
    "NTP before 4.2.8p9 rate limits responses received from the configured sources when rate limiting for all associations is enabled, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (prevent responses from the sources) by sending responses with a spoofed source address.",
    "It was found that when ntp is configured with rate limiting for all associations the limits are also applied to responses received from its configured sources. A remote attacker who knows the sources can cause a denial of service by preventing ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources."
