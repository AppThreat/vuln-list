    "Padding oracle flaw in CloudForms Management Engine (aka CFME) 5 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information.",
    "A padding oracle flaw was found in the encryption of sensitive information stored within the backend database used by CloudForms. An attacker able to submit forged cipher texts could observe the results of encryption and determine information that could, in turn, lead to the disclosure of encrypted data within the database."
