  "details": [
    "libssh before 0.7.3 improperly truncates ephemeral secrets generated for the (1) diffie-hellman-group1 and (2) diffie-hellman-group14 key exchange methods to 128 bits, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions via unspecified vectors, aka a \"bits/bytes confusion bug.\"",
    "A type confusion issue was found in the way libssh generated ephemeral secrets for the diffie-hellman-group1 and diffie-hellman-group14 key exchange methods. This would cause an SSHv2 Diffie-Hellman handshake to use significantly less secure random parameters."
