  "details": [
    "Race condition in the snd_pcm_period_elapsed function in sound/core/pcm_lib.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_START command.",
    "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in ALSA pcm layer, which allows local users to cause a denial of service, memory corruption, or possibly other unspecified impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
