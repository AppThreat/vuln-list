  "details": [
    "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the hiddev_ioctl_usage function in drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 allow local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) HIDIOCGUSAGES or (2) HIDIOCSUSAGES ioctl call.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's hiddev driver. This flaw could allow a local attacker to corrupt kernel memory, possible privilege escalation or crashing the system."
