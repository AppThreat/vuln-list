  "details": [
    "NTP before 4.2.8p9 changes the peer structure to the interface it receives the response from a source, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (prevent communication with a source) by sending a response for a source to an interface the source does not use.",
    "A flaw was found in the way ntpd running on a host with multiple network interfaces handled certain server responses. A remote attacker could use this flaw which would cause ntpd to not synchronize with the source."
