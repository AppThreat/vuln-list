  "details": [
    "Squid 3.x before 3.5.15 and 4.x before 4.0.7 does not properly append data to String objects, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a long string, as demonstrated by a crafted HTTP Vary header.",
    "Incorrect boundary checks were found in the way squid handled headers in HTTP responses, which could lead to an assertion failure. A malicious HTTP server could use this flaw to crash squid using a specially crafted HTTP response."
