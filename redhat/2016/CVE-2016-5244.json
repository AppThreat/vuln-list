  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The rds_inc_info_copy function in net/rds/recv.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 does not initialize a certain structure member, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory by reading an RDS message.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in function rds_inc_info_copy of file net/rds/recv.c. The last field \"flags\" of object \"minfo\" is not initialized. This can leak data previously at the flags location to userspace."
