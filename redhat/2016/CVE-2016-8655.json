  "statement": "This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.\nThis issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future updates for the respective releases will address this issue.\nIn a default or common use of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 this issue does not allow an unprivileged local user elevate their privileges on the system.\nIn order to exploit this issue the attacker needs CAP_NET_RAW capability, which needs to be granted by the administrator to the attacker's account. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not have unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default, local unprivileged users also cannot abuse namespaces to grant this capability to themselves and elevate their privileges.",
  "acknowledgement": "Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson for reporting this issue.",
  "name": "CVE-2016-8655",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Race condition in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.12 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging the CAP_NET_RAW capability to change a socket version, related to the packet_set_ring and packet_setsockopt functions.",
    "A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system."
