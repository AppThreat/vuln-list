  "name": "CVE-2016-10012",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression) in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.",
    "It was found that the boundary checks in the code implementing support for pre-authentication compression could have been optimized out by certain compilers. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could possibly use this flaw for further attacks against the privileged monitor process."
