  "details": [
    "The libvirt driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2015.1.4 (kilo) and 12.0.x before 12.0.3 (liberty), when using raw storage and use_cow_images is set to false, allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files via a crafted qcow2 header in an ephemeral or root disk.",
    "An information-exposure flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) resize and migrate functionality. An authenticated user could write a malicious qcow header to an ephemeral or root disk, referencing a block device as a backing file. With a subsequent resize or migration, file system content on the specified device would be leaked to the user. Only setups using libvirt with raw storage and \"use_cow_images = False\" were affected."
