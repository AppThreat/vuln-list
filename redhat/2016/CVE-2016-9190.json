    "Pillow before 3.3.2 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code by using the \"crafted image file\" approach, related to an \"Insecure Sign Extension\" issue affecting the ImagingNew in Storage.c component.",
    "A vulnerability was found in python-pillow.  A crafted image file with negative dimensions could cause a buffer to be under-allocated, leading to arbitrary writes on the heap which could cause a crash or, potentially, code execution."
