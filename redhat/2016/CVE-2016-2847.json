  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5 does not limit the amount of unread data in pipes, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating many pipes with non-default sizes.",
    "It is possible for a single process to cause an OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A typical process filling 4096 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of memory and there can be multiple such processes, up to a per-user-limit."
