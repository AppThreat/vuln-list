  "details": [
    "OpenStack Image Service (Glance) before 2015.1.3 (kilo) and 11.0.x before 11.0.2 (liberty), when show_multiple_locations is enabled, allow remote authenticated users to change image status and upload new image data by removing the last location of an image.",
    "An authorization vulnerability in OpenStack Image service was discovered, which allowed image-status manipulation using locations. By removing the last location of an image, an authenticated user could change the status from 'active' to 'queue'. A malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to silently replace owned image data, regardless of its original creator or visibility settings. Only environments with show_multiple_locations set to true (not default) were affected."
