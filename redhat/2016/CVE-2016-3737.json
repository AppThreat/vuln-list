  "statement": "It is not feasible to correct this issue with a code change as client SSL certificates need to be created in order to support client authentication.  The installation documentation notes how to mitigate this through the creation of certificates to support SSL authentication.  This mitigation is the best way to correct this issue and, as a result, we will not be releasing any patches to correct the issue.",

  "details": [
    "The server in Red Hat JBoss Operations Network (JON) before 3.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP request, related to message deserialization.",
    "It was discovered that sending specially crafted HTTP request to the JON server would allow deserialization of that message without authentication. An attacker could use this flaw to cause remote code execution."
