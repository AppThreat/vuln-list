Furthermore, Ansible Tower does not pass environment variables to RabbitMQ or Erlang which makes it not affected.\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships the affected Erlang package, however it is only used as a dependency for RabbitMQ and is not exposed outside the management network. As this network is tightly-regulated to OpenStack administrators, the risk for abuse is significantly reduced.",
