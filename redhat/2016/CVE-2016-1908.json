  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The client in OpenSSH before 7.2 mishandles failed cookie generation for untrusted X11 forwarding and relies on the local X11 server for access-control decisions, which allows remote X11 clients to trigger a fallback and obtain trusted X11 forwarding privileges by leveraging configuration issues on this X11 server, as demonstrated by lack of the SECURITY extension on this X11 server.",
    "An access flaw was discovered in OpenSSH; the OpenSSH client did not correctly handle failures to generate authentication cookies for untrusted X11 forwarding. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested."
