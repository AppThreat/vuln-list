    "An issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/arc/emac_main.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5. A use-after-free is caused by a race condition between the functions arc_emac_tx and arc_emac_tx_clean.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Ethernet subsystem of the Linux kernel. A race condition was observed while a data transmission from a buffer occurred when the buffer was already freed causing a use-after-free problem."
