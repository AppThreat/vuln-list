  "statement": "Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform do not include or support openstack-murano, and are therefore not affected by this flaw in any supported configuration.",

  "name": "CVE-2016-4972",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "OpenStack Murano before 1.0.3 (liberty) and 2.x before 2.0.1 (mitaka), Murano-dashboard before 1.0.3 (liberty) and 2.x before 2.0.1 (mitaka), and python-muranoclient before 0.7.3 (liberty) and 0.8.x before 0.8.5 (mitaka) improperly use loaders inherited from yaml.Loader when parsing MuranoPL and UI files, which allows remote attackers to create arbitrary Python objects and execute arbitrary code via crafted extended YAML tags in UI definitions in packages.",
    "A flaw was discovered in openstack-murano processing. Using extended YAML tags in Murano-application YAML files, an attacker could perform remote code execution."
