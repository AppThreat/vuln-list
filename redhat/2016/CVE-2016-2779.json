    "runuser in util-linux allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal's input buffer.",
    "It was found that runuser was vulnerable to TIOCSTI ioctl attacks, allowing the executed program to push characters to its TTY's input buffer. While being executed as a non-privileged user, a specially crafted program could force its parent TTY to enter commands, interpreted by the shell when runuser exits."
