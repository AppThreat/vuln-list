  "details": [
    "Untrusted search path vulnerability in ssh-agent.c in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 7.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary local PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.",
    "It was found that ssh-agent could load PKCS#11 modules from arbitrary paths. An attacker having control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server, and the ability to write to the filesystem of the client host, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ssh-agent."
