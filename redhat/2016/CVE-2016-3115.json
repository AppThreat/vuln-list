  "details": [
    "Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in session.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.2p2 allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended shell-command restrictions via crafted X11 forwarding data, related to the (1) do_authenticated1 and (2) session_x11_req functions.",
    "It was discovered that the OpenSSH server did not sanitize data received in requests to enable X11 forwarding. An authenticated client with restricted SSH access could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended restrictions."
