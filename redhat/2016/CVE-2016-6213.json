  "statement": "This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and MRG-2 as of now due to the absence of unprivileged mount name spaces support.\nNevertheless, the unprivileged mount name spaces might be added to a future RHEL-7 version as a supported feature, so future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases might address this issue.",
  "acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Qian Cai (Red Hat).",
  "name": "CVE-2016-6213",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9 does not restrict how many mounts may exist in a mount namespace, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and deadlock) via MS_BIND mount system calls, as demonstrated by a loop that triggers exponential growth in the number of mounts.",
    "It was found that in Linux kernel the mount table expands by a power-of-two with each bind mount command. If a system is configured to allow non-privileged user to do bind mounts, or allows to do so in a container or unprivileged mount namespace, then non-privileged user is able to cause a local DoS by overflowing the mount table, which causes a deadlock for the whole system."
