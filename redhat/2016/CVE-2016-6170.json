  "details": [
    "ISC BIND through 9.9.9-P1, 9.10.x through 9.10.4-P1, and 9.11.x through 9.11.0b1 allows primary DNS servers to cause a denial of service (secondary DNS server crash) via a large AXFR response, and possibly allows IXFR servers to cause a denial of service (IXFR client crash) via a large IXFR response and allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (primary DNS server crash) via a large UPDATE message.",
    "It was found that bind does not implement reasonable restrictions for zone sizes. This allows an explicitly configured primary DNS server for a zone to crash a secondary DNS server, affecting service of other zones hosted on the same secondary server."
