  "details": [
    "The library's failure to check if certain message types support a particular flag, the HDF5 1.8.16 library will cast the structure to an alternative structure and then assign to fields that aren't supported by the message type and the library will write outside the bounds of the heap buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the library.",
    "Multiple heap overflows were found in HDF5. These issues could be used to gain code execution in any program that exposes the affected functions to untrusted input. While HDF5 is shipped as a dependency, no Red Hat products are known to expose these issues in any supported use case at this time."
