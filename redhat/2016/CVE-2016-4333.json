  "details": [
    "The HDF5 1.8.16 library allocating space for the array using a value from the file has an impact within the loop for initializing said array allowing a value within the file to modify the loop's terminator. Due to this, an aggressor can cause the loop's index to point outside the bounds of the array when initializing it.",
    "Multiple heap overflows were found in HDF5. These issues could be used to gain code execution in any program that exposes the affected functions to untrusted input. While HDF5 is shipped as a dependency, no Red Hat products are known to expose these issues in any supported use case at this time."
