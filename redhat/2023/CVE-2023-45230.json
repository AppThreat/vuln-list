  "statement": "The buffer overflow vulnerability identified in EDK2 is of significant importance due to its potential impact on system security. As the open-source reference implementation of the UEFI specification, EDK2 plays a crucial role in system boot processes. The discovered flaw allows an unauthorized attacker within the local network to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted DHCPv6 message, leading to an information leak and compromising system availability. Given the fundamental role of UEFI in system functionality, addressing and patching this issue promptly is crucial to prevent potential security breaches and ensure the integrity of the overall system.",

  "details": [
    "EDK2's Network Package is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability via a long server ID option in DHCPv6 client. This\nvulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized \naccess and potentially lead to a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and/or Availability.",
    "A security flaw was identified in EDK2, the open-source reference implementation of the UEFI specification, involving a buffer overflow vulnerability. This particular weakness enables an unauthorized attacker within the vicinity of the network to transmit a specifically crafted DHCPv6 message. This, in turn, could result in an information disclosure and compromise the availability of the system."
