    "A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch \u003c6.1.7.1 and \u003c7.0.4.1 related to the If-None-Match header. A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on a version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.",
    "A flaw was found in the rubygem-actionpack. RubyGem's actionpack gem is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in Action Dispatch related to the If-None-Match header. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP If-None-Match header, a remote attacker can use large amounts of CPU and memory, resulting in a denial of service."
