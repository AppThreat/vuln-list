The CVE-2023-2295 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it is not applicable to any upstream libreswan version or libreswan packages of any other vendor that are not directly based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages.\nFor more details about the original security issue CVE-2023-30570, refer to the CVE page: https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-30570.",

    "A vulnerability was found in the libreswan library. This security issue occurs when an IKEv1 Aggressive Mode packet is received with only unacceptable crypto algorithms, and the response packet is not sent with a zero responder SPI. When a subsequent packet is received where the sender reuses the libreswan responder SPI as its own initiator SPI, the pluto daemon state machine crashes. No remote code execution is possible. This CVE exists because of a CVE-2023-30570 security regression for libreswan package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2.",
