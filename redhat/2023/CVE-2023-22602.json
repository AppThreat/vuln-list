  "details": [
    "When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass.\nThe authentication bypass occurs when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and Spring Boot \u003c 2.6 default to Ant style pattern matching.\nMitigation: Update to Apache Shiro 1.11.0, or set the following Spring Boot configuration value:  `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ant_path_matcher`",
    "A flaw was found in Apache Shiro. This issue may allow a malicious user to send a specially crafted HTTP request that could cause an authentication bypass."
