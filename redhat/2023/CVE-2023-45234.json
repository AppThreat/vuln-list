    "EDK2's Network Package is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability when processing DNS Servers option from a DHCPv6 Advertise message. This\nvulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized \naccess and potentially lead to a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and/or Availability.",
    "A security weakness was identified in EDK2, the open-source reference implementation of the UEFI specification, revealing a buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability enables an unauthorized attacker within proximity on the network to transmit a specifically crafted DHCPv6 Advertise message. As a consequence, it results in the unauthorized disclosure of information and jeopardizes the availability of the system."
