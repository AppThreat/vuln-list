  "details": [
    "An integer underflow flaw was discovered in libspf2 library which exists within the parsing of SPF macros. When parsing SPF macros, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent unprivileged attackers to execute code in the context of the service account."
