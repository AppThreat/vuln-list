  "details": [
    "A stack-based buffer overflow in ParseColors in libXm in Common Desktop Environment 1.6 can be exploited by local low-privileged users via the dtprintinfo setuid binary to escalate their privileges to root on Solaris 10 systems. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
    "A flaw was found in libXm, a library distributed by the motif package. A specially crafted XPM file with long color strings can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow in the ParseColors function due to the unsafe use of the strcat function, resulting in privilege escalation."
