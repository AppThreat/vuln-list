  "details": [
    "A maliciously-crafted image can cause excessive CPU consumption in decoding. A tiled image with a height of 0 and a very large width can cause excessive CPU consumption, despite the image size (width * height) appearing to be zero.",
    "A flaw was found in the Golang tiff package, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by an excessive iteration flaw. By persuading a victim to open a specially crafted image file, a remote attacker can cause excessive CPU consumption in decoding, resulting in a denial of service condition."
