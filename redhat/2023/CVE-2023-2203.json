The CVE-2023-2203 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it is not applicable to any upstream WebKitGTK version or WebKitGTK packages of any other vendor that are not directly based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages.\nFor more details about the original security issue CVE-2023-28205, refer to the CVE page: https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-28205.",
