  "details": [
    "Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing them on multiple queues, and processing them later. Reflected XSS issue occurs when /queues is appended with /\"\u003e\u003csvg%20onload=alert(domain)\u003e. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.0.",
    "A cross-site scripting flaw was found in Resque due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the Queue Endpoint. This issue could allow a remote authenticated attacker to use a specially crafted URL to execute script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting web site once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials."
