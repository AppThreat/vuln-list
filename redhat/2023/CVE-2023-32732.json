    "gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a termination of connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server: a base64 encoding error for `-bin` suffixed headers will result in a disconnection by the gRPC server, but is typically allowed by HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit inÂ  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309 https://www.google.com/url",
    "A flaw was found in gRPC, which is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a base64 encoding error for \"-bin\" suffixed headers. By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker can cause a termination of the connection between an HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server, resulting in a denial of service."
