  "details": [
    "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. In affected versions a missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of Bound Read in the function `gdi_multi_opaque_rect`. In particular there is no code to validate if the value `multi_opaque_rect-\u003enumRectangles` is less than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect-\u003e`numRectangles without proper boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
    "A flaw was found in FreeRDP. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect-\u003e`numRectangles without proper boundary checks can lead to a heap-buffer-overflow, which may result in a crash."
