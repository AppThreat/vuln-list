  "details": [
    "The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto 1.3.2 through 2.x before 2.0.16 has a memory leak that can be abused remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.",
    "A memory leak vulnerability was found in Eclipse Mosquitto. This issue is triggered by malicious initial packets or certain client actions and may allow a remote attacker to the deplete system resources causing memory exhaustion, leading to a disruption in services and a denial of service condition."
