    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nsh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug\nThe original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()\nin switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop\nthe worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,\na use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:\n(cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)\nswitch_drv_remove()              |\nflush_work()                    |\n...                            |  switch_timer // timer\n|   schedule_work(\u0026psw-\u003ework)\ntimer_shutdown_sync()           |\n...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker\nkfree(psw) // free              |\n|   psw-\u003estate = 0 // use\nThis patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to\nmitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be\nstopped safely before the deallocate operations.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the push-switch driver of Linux Kernel due to improper cleanup sequence in switch_drv_remove(). Originally, flush_work() was placed before timer_shutdown_sync(), allowing the worker to potentially be rescheduled in switch_timer() and causing a use-after-free bug."
