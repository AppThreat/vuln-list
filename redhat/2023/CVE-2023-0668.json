  "details": [
    "Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted IEEE-C37.118 packet, Wireshark version 4.0.5 and prior, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution in the context of the process running Wireshark.",
    "A flaw was found in the IEEE C37.118 Synchrophasor dissector of Wireshark. This issue occurs when decoding malformed packets from a pcap file or from the network, causing a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service."
