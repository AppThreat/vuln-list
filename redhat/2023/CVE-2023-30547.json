  "details": [
    "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. There exists a vulnerability in exception sanitization of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.16, allowing attackers to raise an unsanitized host exception inside `handleException()` which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.17` of `vm2`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.",
    "A flaw was found in the vm2 sandbox. When exception handling is triggered, an unsanitized host is not managed properly. This issue may allow an attacker to bypass the sandbox protections, which can lead to remote code execution on the hypervisor host or the host that is running the sandbox."
