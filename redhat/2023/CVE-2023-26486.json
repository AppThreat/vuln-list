  "details": [
    "Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. The Vega `scale` expression function has the ability to call arbitrary functions with a single controlled argument. The scale expression function passes a user supplied argument group to getScale, which is then used as if it were an internal context. The context.scales[name].value is accessed from group and called as a function back in scale. This can be exploited to escape the Vega expression sandbox in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript. This issue has been fixed in version 5.13.1.",
    "A flaw was found in one of Kibanaâ€™s dependencies. This flaw allows an attacker to perform Cross-site scripting (XSS) after loading a maliciously crafted custom visualization in Kibana."
