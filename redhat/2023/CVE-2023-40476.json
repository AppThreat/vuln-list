  "details": [
    "GStreamer H265 Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of H265 encoded video files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-21768.",
    "A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the GStreamer Plugins Bad when handling malformed files with H.265 video streams. This issue requires user interaction with the library and may allow a malicious user to cause an integer overflow before allocating the buffer, triggering a crash or code execution via heap manipulation, executing code in the context of the current process."
