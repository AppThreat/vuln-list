  "details": [
    "redis-py before 4.4.4 and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 leaves a connection open after canceling an async Redis command at an inopportune time, and can send response data to the client of an unrelated request. (This could, for example, happen for a non-pipeline operation.) NOTE: the solutions for CVE-2023-28859 address data leakage across AsyncIO connections in general.",
    "A flaw was found in Redis redis-py. This flaw allows a remote, authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information caused by an issue with leaving a connection open after canceling an async Redis command at an inopportune time. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker can obtain sensitive information and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system."
