  "statement": "For this vulnerability in Perl,  a successful exploitation may involve navigating through intricate aspects of the code related to user-defined Unicode properties and executing an attack that writes past the buffer end. So the higher attack complexity implies that it would be more challenging for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability successfully, requiring a greater level of sophistication and effort. Due to this elevated level of difficulty, the vulnerability has been marked with a moderate severity rating.",
