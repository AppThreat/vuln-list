  "statement": "The Floating Point Exception discovered in espeak-ng within the PeaksToHarmspect function in wavegen.c is assessed as a low severity issue due to its limited impact and mitigating factors. Primarily, the occurrence of Floating Point Exceptions typically arises from non-standard floating-point operations, often involving division by zero or invalid arithmetic operations. However, these exceptions commonly trigger robust error handling mechanisms inherent in modern operating systems and programming environments, preventing program crashes or security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the specific context of the issue within the PeaksToHarmspect function suggests its occurrence within a particular computational routine for generating waveforms, likely constrained to specific usage scenarios and input conditions. Consequently, its impact is localized and may not manifest in typical usage scenarios or pose significant risks to system stability or security.",
