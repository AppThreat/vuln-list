  "statement": "To exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set the virt-handler service account to all other nodes to unschedulable, and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node. Since this requires a node to be compromised first, the impact of this issue is considered Moderate.",

  "name": "CVE-2023-26484",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In versions 0.59.0 and prior, if a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs. This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged components which can, for instance, read all secrets on the cluster, or can exec into pods on other nodes. This way, a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster. The simplest way to exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node. No patches are available as of time of publication. As a workaround, gatekeeper users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a node.",
    "A flaw was found in the Kubevirt package. KubeVirt could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions caused by improper authorization validation. An attacker can modify all node specs by sending a specially-crafted request using the virt-handler service account."
