    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nx86/mm: Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit type\nOn 64-bit platforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the input\nvalue is 64 bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't get\nlost when shifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physical\naddress to provide a virtual address for.\nOne such example is in pvalidate_pages() (used by SEV-SNP guests), where\nthe GFN in the struct used for page-state change requests is a 40-bit\nbit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN field directly into\npfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealing with addresses\nabove the 1TB range due to the above.\nFix this issue with SEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases that\nmight cause issues in current/future code, by using an inline function,\ninstead of a macro, so that the input is implicitly cast to the\nexpected 64-bit input type prior to performing the shift operation.\nWhile it might be argued that the issue is on the caller side, other\narchs/macros have taken similar approaches to deal with instances like\nthis, such as ARM explicitly casting the input to phys_addr_t:\ne48866647b48 (\"ARM: 8396/1: use phys_addr_t in pfn_to_kaddr()\")\nA C inline function is even better though.\n[ mingo: Refined the changelog some more \u0026 added __always_inline. ]"
