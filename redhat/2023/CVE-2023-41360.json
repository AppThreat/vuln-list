  "statement": "In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the vulnerable code is not included. It was added in FRR-8.4 in upstream. The highest version of FRR utilized in RHEL-8 is 7.5. Hence, versions of FRR shipped with RHEL-8 are not affected by this vulnerability.\nRed Hat Product Security rated this vulnerability as a LOW security impact because it only exposes the initial byte of the ORF header in an ahead-of-stream situation.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0. bgpd/bgp_packet.c can read the initial byte of the ORF header in an ahead-of-stream situation.",
    "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in FRRouting in bgpd/bgp_packet.c, resulting from a boundary condition. This flaw allows a remote attacker, through specially crafted input, to read the initial byte of the ORF header in an ahead-of-stream scenario. This attacker can gain information and potentially launch further attacks against the affected system."
