  "details": [
    "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in Apache ZooKeeper. If SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled in ZooKeeper (quorum.auth.enableSasl=true), the authorization is done by verifying that the instance part in SASL authentication ID is listed in zoo.cfg server list. The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional and if it's missing, like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM', the authorization check will be skipped. As a result an arbitrary endpoint could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader, essentially giving it complete read-write access to the data tree. Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled by default.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1, 3.8.3, 3.7.2, which fixes the issue.\nAlternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.\nSee the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache ZooKeeper. Authorization bypass through user-controlled key is available iff SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled in ZooKeeper via quorum.auth.enableSasl=true configuration. A malicious user could bypass the authentication controller by using a non-existing instance part in SASL authentication ID (which is optional), therefore, the server would skip this check and as a result, join the cluster and propagate information with complete read and write access."
