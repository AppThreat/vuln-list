  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "If a resolver cache has a very large number of ECS records stored for the same name, the process of cleaning the cache database node for this name can significantly impair query performance. \nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.",
    "A flaw was found in the bind9 package. This issue may allow an attacker to substantially decrease `named` performance by sending a specific set of queries, forcing the same name to have a large number of ECS records stored. In the worst case scenario, `named` can become unresponsive, leading to a Denial of Service."
