  "statement": "The Sendmail vulnerability allowing SMTP smuggling is deemed moderate due to its impact on SPF protection mechanisms and specific conditions for successful exploitation. SMTP smuggling involves manipulating the communication between mail servers to inject unauthorized messages. Exploiting this flaw involves a technique where remote attackers inject email messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address. This manipulation allows them to bypass SPF protections because Sendmail supports the \u003cLF\u003e.\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e sequence, which some other popular email servers do not.",
  "acknowledgement": "",
  "name": "CVE-2023-51765",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "sendmail through 8.17.2 allows SMTP smuggling in certain configurations. Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because sendmail supports \u003cLF\u003e.\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e but some other popular e-mail servers do not. This is resolved in 8.18 and later versions with 'o' in srv_features.",
    "A flaw was found in some SMTP server configurations in Sendmail. This issue may allow a remote attacker to break out of the email message data to \"smuggle\" SMTP commands and send spoofed emails that pass SPF checks."
