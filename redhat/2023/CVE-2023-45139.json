  "statement": "Note that the impact is dependent on the environment fontTools is running in.

  "name": "CVE-2023-45139",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The subsetting module has a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability which allows an attacker to resolve arbitrary entities when a candidate font (OT-SVG fonts), which contains a SVG table, is parsed. This allows attackers to include arbitrary files from the filesystem fontTools is running on or make web requests from the host system. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.43.0.",
    "A flaw was found in the subsetting module of FontTools, which contains an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability. This flaw allows malicious actors to exploit the parsing of candidate fonts, particularly those with an OT-SVG format that includes an SVG table. Through this vulnerability, attackers can manipulate the system to resolve arbitrary entities, potentially allowing them to include files from the filesystem where FontTools is operating or even initiate web requests from the host system."
