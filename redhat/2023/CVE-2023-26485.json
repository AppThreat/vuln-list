    "cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has been addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should validate that their input comes from trusted sources.\n### Impact\nA polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.\n### Proof of concept\n```\n$ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = \"_\" * 100000; print(pad + \".\" + pad, end=\"\")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext\n```\nIncreasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase quadratically.\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10.\n### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm\nXXX: TBD\n[cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time, but share a common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. \n### Credit\nWe would like to thank @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability.\n### References\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [github/cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)",
