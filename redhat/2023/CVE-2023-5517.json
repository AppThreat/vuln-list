    "A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when:\n- `nxdomain-redirect \u003cdomain\u003e;` is configured, and\n- the resolver receives a PTR query for an RFC 1918 address that would normally result in an authoritative NXDOMAIN response.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.12.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.",
    "A flaw was found in the bind package which may result in a Denial of Service in `named` process. This is a result of a reachable assertion, leading `named` to prematurely terminate when both conditions are met: nxdomain-redirect for the queried domain is configured and the resolver receives a PTR query, used for a reverse DNS lookup, for a RFC 1918 address that would normally result in an authoritative `NXDOMAIN` response. A single query matching both conditions can lead to a Denial of Service in the named application."
