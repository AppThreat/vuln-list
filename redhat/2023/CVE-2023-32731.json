  "details": [
    "When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it skipped parsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK table mutations to also be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization of HPACK tables between sender and receiver. If leveraged, say, between a proxy and a backend, this could lead to requests from the proxy being interpreted as containing headers from different proxy clients - leading to an information leak that can be used for privilege escalation or data exfiltration. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit contained inÂ  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005 https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005",
    "A flaw was found in gRPC. This flaw allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a flaw when the gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker can obtain sensitive information, and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system."
