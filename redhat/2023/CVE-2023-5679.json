  "mitigation": "This vulnerability can be mitigated by either disabled server-stale configuration, using both of the switches bellow in named configuration file:\n1) set stale-cache-enable no;\n2) set stale-answer-enable no;\nAlternatively, disable the DNS64 option. Both mitigations should make the affected code unreachable, making it impossible to an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.",

    "A bad interaction between DNS64 and serve-stale may cause `named` to crash with an assertion failure during recursive resolution, when both of these features are enabled.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.",
    "A flaw was found in the bind package. This issue may allow an attacker to query in a DNS64 enabled resolver node with a domain name triggering a server-stale data, triggering a code assertion, and resulting in a crash of `named` processes. This can allow a remote unauthenticated user to cause a Denial Of Service in the DNS server."
