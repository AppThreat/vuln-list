To process files with a directory traversal pattern, a command line flag could be introduced, as done in GNU cpio.\nUsers can specify on the BusyBox cpio command line which file name should be unpacked, which should be safe as long as no directory traversal is included in that file name argument.\nUsers may also consider using another cpio implementation, or may ensure that archive files are trusted.",

If untrusted archives are extracted, this can result in files written outside of the destination directory or files being overwritten that contain configuration in the form of shell scripts such as ~/.bashrc or scripts that enable login from a remote side such as the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file."
