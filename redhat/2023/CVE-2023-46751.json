  "statement": "The discovered vulnerability in the function gdev_prn_open_printer_seekable() within Artifex Ghostscript, poses a moderate severity threat due to its potential to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Exploiting this flaw involves manipulating a dangling pointer, which can lead to crashing the application. While the impact is limited to crashing the application, the exploit requires remote access, which elevates the risk compared to local-only vulnerabilities.",
