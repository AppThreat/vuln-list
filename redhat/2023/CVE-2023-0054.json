    "Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.1145.",
    "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in Vim, in the do_string_sub function in the eval.c file. The issue occurs because of an invalid memory access due to a missing check of the return value of the vim_regsub function when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file to trigger the out-of-bounds write, causing the application to crash."
