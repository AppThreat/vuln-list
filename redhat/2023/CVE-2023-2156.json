The flaw cannot be triggered if the `rpl_seg_enabled` sysctl is set to 0. Please note that the `rpl_seg_enabled` sysctl is not enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. As such, the impact has been lowered to Moderate on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the networking subsystem of the Linux kernel within the handling of the RPL protocol. This issue results from the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data, which can lead to an assertion failure. This may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition on the system.",
