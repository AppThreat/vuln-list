  "statement": "The libxml2 project does not consider this issue to be a vulnerability because it can only be triggered in an out-of-memory condition or when the --maxmem command line option of the xmllint program is used to limit the number of memory allocation done by the parser. This is intended behavior and it's used to detect similar issues.\nRed Hat Product Security agrees with that decision. However, Red Hat will try to address this issue in affected products.",

  "details": [
    "libxml2 through 2.11.5 has a use-after-free that can only occur after a certain memory allocation fails. This occurs in xmlUnlinkNode in tree.c. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"I don't think these issues are critical enough to warrant a CVE ID ... because an attacker typically can't control when memory allocations fail.\"",
    "A flaw was found in libxml2. In an out-of-memory condition or when limiting the memory allocation, processing a XML document using the HTML parser may result in a use-after-free vulnerability."
