  "statement": "\"Mayhem\" is a potent attack technique that focuses on the core components of computing systems, specifically the CPU internals and stack variables. This method signifies a noteworthy advancement in cyber threats, demonstrating the ability to tamper with a computer's memory and compromise both stack and register variables. Capitalizing on the well-known Rowhammer effect, where swift access to a DRAM row induces bit flips in neighboring rows, this attack exploits these bit flips to disrupt stack variables and manipulate register values within a given process. The manipulation is accomplished by targeting register values stored in the process' stack, which, once flushed out to memory, become vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks. When reloaded, these corrupted values cause chaos, compromising the integrity of the entire process. It's important to note that this attack is confined to the local system, leading us to categorize it as a moderate threat.\nRed Hat has determined this vulnerability to be a moderate impact because it targets the local system and lacks a widespread impact beyond compromising the integrity of individual processes by exploiting CPU internals and stack variables.\nThe research presented in the provided link introduces the attack described below: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02545",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "OpenSSH through 9.6, when common types of DRAM are used, might allow row hammer attacks (for authentication bypass) because the integer value of authenticated in mm_answer_authpassword does not resist flips of a single bit. NOTE: this is applicable to a certain threat model of attacker-victim co-location in which the attacker has user privileges.",
