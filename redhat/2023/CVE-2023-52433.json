  "mitigation": "1. This flaw can be mitigated by preventing the affected netfilter (nf_tables) kernel module from being loaded. For instructions on how to blacklist a kernel module, please see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278.\n2. If the module cannot be disabled, on non-containerized deployments of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the mitigation is to disable user namespaces:\n```\n# echo \"user.max_user_namespaces=0\" \u003e /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n```\nOn containerized deployments such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, do not use the second mitigation (disabling user namespaces) as the functionality is needed to be enabled. The first mitigation (blacklisting nf_tables) is still viable for containerized deployments, providing the environment is not using netfilter.",
