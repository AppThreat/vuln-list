  "details": [
    "Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
    "A heap use-after-free flaw was found in the vim package. When executing a `:s` command for the first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the substitution, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes memory to be freed, which may later then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. This issue may result in Vim crashing."
