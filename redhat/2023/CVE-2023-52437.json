    "This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority for the following reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's md/raid5 driver, specifically introduced by commit 5e2cf333b7bd. This commit triggers a race condition wherein the system hangs due to improper handling of MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING flags. During the execution of md_write_start, if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is set and concurrently cleared by raid5d, it can lead to a deadlock situation. This results in system unresponsiveness, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS)."
