  "details": [
    "The fix for XSA-423 added logic to Linux'es netback driver to deal with\na frontend splitting a packet in a way such that not all of the headers\nwould come in one piece.  Unfortunately the logic introduced there\ndidn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet being split\ninto as many pieces as permitted by the protocol, yet still being\nsmaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all (possible)\nheaders together.  Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger a\nbuffer overrun in the driver.",
    "A buffer overrun vulnerability was found in the netback driver in Xen due to an unusual split packet. This flaw allows an unprivileged guest to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the host by sending network packets to the backend, causing the backend to crash."
