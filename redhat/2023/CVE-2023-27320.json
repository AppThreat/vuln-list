  "statement": "The CHROOT support was only added in Sudo v1.9.3 and Sudo v1.9.8 included a fix for a memory leak in the set_cmnd_path() function, which can result in the \"user_cmnd\" variable being freed twice, but only when processing a sudoers rule that contains a \"CHROOT\" setting. This does not affect the \"chroot\" Defaults setting. Only a per-rule \"CHROOT\" setting will trigger the bug.\nHence, it only affects Sudo v1.9.8 through to 1.9.13p1. \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux - 6, 7, 8, 9 are shipped with lower versions of Sudo that doesn't contains the vulnerable code. Thus, they are not affected.",

  "details": [
    "Sudo before 1.9.13p2 has a double free in the per-command chroot feature.",
    "A double-free vulnerability was found in Sudo in the per-command chroot feature. This flaw exists due to a boundary error when matching a sudoer rule that contains a per-command chroot directive (CHROOT=dir). By sending a specially-crafted request, a local privileged attacker can elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code on the system."
