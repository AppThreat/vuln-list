    "A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch \u003c6.0.6.1,\u003c 6.1.7.1, and \u003c7.0.4.1. Specially crafted cookies, in combination with a specially crafted X_FORWARDED_HOST header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.",
    "A flaw was found in the rubygem-actionpack. RubyGem's actionpack gem is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the Action Dispatch module. By sending specially-crafted cookies with an X_FORWARDED_HOST header, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to use large amounts of CPU and memory, resulting in a denial of service."
