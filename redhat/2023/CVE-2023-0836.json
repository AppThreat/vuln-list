  "details": [
    "An information leak vulnerability was discovered in HAProxy 2.1, 2.2 before 2.2.27, 2.3, 2.4 before 2.4.21, 2.5 before 2.5.11, 2.6 before 2.6.8, 2.7 before 2.7.1. There are 5 bytes left uninitialized in the connection buffer when encoding the FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST record. Sensitive data may be disclosed to configured FastCGI backends in an unexpected way.",
    "A flaw was found in HAProxy, which could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information caused by improper initialization when encoding the FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST record. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system."
