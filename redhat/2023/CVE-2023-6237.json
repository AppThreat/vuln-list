  "statement": "Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of this flaw as determined by the upstream OpenSSL security team.\nThe marked moderate issue in OpenSSL involves a flaw in the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function used for RSA public keys. When verifying keys, the computation to confirm the composite nature of the RSA modulus may take an extended time if the modulus is a large prime. This vulnerability could be exploited for a Denial of Service attack in applications using this function with RSA keys from untrusted sources. The severity is moderate as it requires specific conditions for exploitation and may not pose an immediate widespread threat.",

  "details": [
    "Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take\na long time.\nImpact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that\nis being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead\nto a Denial of Service.\nWhen function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,\na computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.\nFor valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this\ncomputation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,\nthen this computation would take a long time.\nAn application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key\nobtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service\nattack.\nThe function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL\nfunctions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line\napplication. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used\nwith the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.",
