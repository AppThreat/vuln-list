  "details": [
    "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy’s HTTP/2 codec may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving `RST_STREAM` immediately followed by the `GOAWAY` frames from an upstream server. In nghttp2, cleanup of pending requests due to receipt of the `GOAWAY` frame skips de-allocation of the bookkeeping structure and pending compressed header. The error return [code path] is taken if connection is already marked for not sending more requests due to `GOAWAY` frame. The clean-up code is right after the return statement, causing memory leak. Denial of service through memory exhaustion. This vulnerability was patched in versions(s) 1.26.3, 1.25.8, 1.24.9, 1.23.11.",
    "A flaw was found in Envoy, where a specifically crafted response from an untrusted upstream service can cause a denial of service through memory exhaustion. This issue is caused by Envoy’s HTTP/2 codec, which may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving RST_STREAM immediately, followed by the GOAWAY frames from an upstream server."
