    "A flaw was found in the SMB client component in the Linux kernel. In case of an error in smb3_fs_context_parse_param, `ctx-\u003epassword` was freed, but the field was not set to NULL, potentially leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system."
