    "Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.1144.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in Vim in the msg_puts_printf function in the message.c file. The issue occurs because of an invalid memory access when calculating the length of a string when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the heap-based buffer overflow, causing the application to crash."
