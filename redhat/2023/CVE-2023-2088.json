  "statement": "There are two ways this flaw can be triggered:\nIntentional Type - A malicious user could use Cinder to detach their own volume. As Nova is not made aware of the situation, it might later grant the attacker access to a new volume of another user (later referred to as victim). As there are very little restrictions on how often this can be triggered and the victim might not have any way to identify if their volumes have been compromised,  the impact to Cinder has been rated Critical. \nAccident Type - This can occur if communication between Nova and Cinder is interrupted during a volume detachment process. A potential attacker seeking to exploit this type would need real-time access to logs and the ability to tamper with the private network. Due to these significant restrictions against triggering the vulnerability, components affected by this type are rated as Important.\nWithin Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, it is not possible to eliminate the intentional type by code changes alone. Changes to policy and configuration are also required to restrict this vector.  For details read the KCS article linked in the mitigation section.",
