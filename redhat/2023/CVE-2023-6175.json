  "statement": "Although arbitrary code execution may be possible, default memory protections in Red Hat Enterprise Linux should prevent this flaw from causing a higher impact than an application crash. \nWireshark is not an application that runs with elevated privileges, limiting the exploitability and impact of this issue to the user's context.
