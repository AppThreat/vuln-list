  "statement": "While the discovered flaw in WebKitGTK does indeed present a concerning potential for arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption, its severity is assessed as moderate rather than critical for several reasons. Firstly, successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires the user to interact with malicious HTML content, typically through visiting a compromised website. This dependency on user interaction reduces the likelihood of widespread exploitation compared to vulnerabilities that can be remotely exploited without user interaction. Additionally, the impact of the flaw may be mitigated by various security measures such as sandboxing or Content Security Policy (CSP) enforcement, which can limit the execution environment for potentially malicious code.",

    "The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed in Safari 17.2, macOS Sonoma 14.2, watchOS 10.2, iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2, tvOS 17.2. Processing web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "A flaw was found in WebKitGTK. This issue exists due to a boundary error when processing malicious HTML content in WebKit, which could result in memory corruption and arbitrary code execution on the target system."
