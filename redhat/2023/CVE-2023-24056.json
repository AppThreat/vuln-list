  "details": [
    "In pkgconf through 1.9.3, variable duplication can cause unbounded string expansion due to incorrect checks in libpkgconf/tuple.c:pkgconf_tuple_parse. For example, a .pc file containing a few hundred bytes can expand to one billion bytes.",
    "A flaw was found in pkgconf, where a variable duplication can cause unbounded string expansion due to incorrect checks in libpkgconf/tuple.c:pkgconf_tuple_parse. This issue may lead to a buffer overflow, which can crash the software."
