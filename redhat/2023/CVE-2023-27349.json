    "BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP Improper Validation of Array Index Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code via Bluetooth on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19908.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP, stemming from the improper validation of array indices. This flaw resides in the AVRCP protocol handling and arises due to inadequate validation of user-supplied data. Consequently, it may lead to writing beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer. This flaw possibly allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute code within the root context via Bluetooth."
