  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0. There is an out-of-bounds read in bgp_attr_aigp_valid in bgpd/bgp_attr.c because there is no check for the availability of two bytes during AIGP validation.",
    "A flaw was found in FRRouting that involves a heap-based buffer overflow in the bgp_attr_aigp_valid() function within bgpd/bgp_attr.c. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted data to the application, initiating an out-of-bounds read error and executing a denial of service (DoS) attack."
