  "statement": "This vulnerability allows for a denial of service attack to be performed against applications that process  untrusted GVariant input, compromising application availability by consuming excessive processing time or utilizing a large quantity of memory. The most likely threat is from a local user, which may be possible depending on the configuration of the service and the format of parameters that it expects. While a remote attack is possible if the application is configured to read GVariants over a network connection, this is not the default configuration which makes the likelihood low. Because the most widely available attack vector is local and the consequences are limited to denial of service, Red Hat Product Security rates the impact as Low.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in glib, where the gvariant deserialization code is vulnerable to a denial of service introduced by additional input validation added to resolve CVE-2023-29499. The offset table validation may be very slow. This bug does not affect any released version of glib but does affect glib distributors who followed the guidance of glib developers to backport the initial fix for CVE-2023-29499.",
