  "statement": "The vulnerability identified as CVE-2023-24023, dubbed \"Bluetooth Forward and Future Secrecy Attacks and Defenses (BLUFFS),\" is categorized as having moderate severity due to several factors. While it does allow for potential Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) attacks between paired Bluetooth BR/EDR devices, its impact is somewhat limited by certain conditions. Firstly, successful exploitation requires the attacker to be within wireless range of the vulnerable devices during the encryption procedure initiation. Additionally, the attacker's ability to force a reduction in encryption key length may not guarantee real-time brute-forcing of the key, particularly if it exceeds 7 octets.",

    "Bluetooth BR/EDR devices with Secure Simple Pairing and Secure Connections pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2 through 5.4 allow certain man-in-the-middle attacks that force a short key length, and might lead to discovery of the encryption key and live injection, aka BLUFFS.",
