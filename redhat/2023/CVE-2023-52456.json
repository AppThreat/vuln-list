  "statement": "This vulnerability is considered of Moderate severity because it leads to a deadlock in the transmission state machine, rendering the RS485 interface non-functional and potentially disrupting serial communication. While it does not directly compromise data integrity or security, it can cause significant operational issues, especially in systems relying on continuous and reliable RS485 communication. The impact is limited to the availability of the serial interface rather than the broader system, and it requires a specific condition—an unexpected TTY port closure during transmission—to be triggered.",

  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nserial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock\nWhen using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to\ncontrol the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the\nTTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during\nuserland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface\nand disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,\nimx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered\nby the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx\nstatemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in\ndeadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.\nimx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC\ninterrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure\nthe state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to\nWAIT_AFTER_SEND.",
    "A flaw was found in the UART driver handling RS485 communication in the Linux Kernel when an unexpected closure of the TTY port occurs, such as during a userland application crash. In this scenario, the imx_uart_shutdown function disables the UART interface and the Transmission Complete (TC) interrupt. Subsequently, the imx_uart_stop_tx function attempts to stop the transmission but exits prematurely if the transmission is incomplete, expecting the now-disabled TC interrupt to complete the process. This results in the transmission state machine remaining in a deadlocked SEND state, leaving the TX_EN pin low and rendering the RS485 interface non-functional. This vulnerability can lead to communication failures and potential system instability."
