    "In spring AMQP versions 1.0.0 to\n2.4.16 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.9 , allowed list patterns for deserializable class\nnames were added to Spring AMQP, allowing users to lock down deserialization of\ndata in messages from untrusted sources; however by default, when no allowed\nlist was provided, all classes could be deserialized.\nSpecifically, an application is\nvulnerable if\n*  the\nSimpleMessageConverter or SerializerMessageConverter is used\n*  the user\ndoes not configure allowed list patterns\n*  untrusted\nmessage originators gain permissions to write messages to the RabbitMQ\nbroker to send malicious content",
    "A flaw was found in Spring Framework AMQP. An allowed list exists in Spring AMQP, but when no allowed list is provided, all classes could be deserialized, allowing a malicious user to send harmful content to the broker."
