  "statement": "The out-of-bounds read vulnerability in EDK2 represents a moderate security concern. This flaw, found in the open-source implementation of the UEFI specification, allows an attacker within the local network to exploit the issue by sending a carefully crafted Neighbor Discovery Redirect message. While requiring proximity for exploitation, the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized memory access and potential leakage of sensitive information.",

  "details": [
    "EDK2's Network Package is susceptible to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability when processingÂ  Neighbor Discovery Redirect message. This\nvulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized \naccess and potentially lead to a loss of Confidentiality.",
    "A security loophole involving an out-of-bounds read was identified in EDK2, the open-source reference implementation of the UEFI specification. This vulnerability enables an unauthorized attacker within the vicinity of the network to transmit a specifically crafted Neighbor Discovery Redirect message. Consequently, this may lead to the unauthorized reading of memory beyond the message boundaries, potentially resulting in the exposure of sensitive information."
