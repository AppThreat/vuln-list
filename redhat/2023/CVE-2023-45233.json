  "statement": "The identified vulnerability in EDK2's Network Package poses a moderate risk due to an infinite loop in the Ip6IsOptionValid function, specifically when parsing a PadN option in the Destination Options header of an IPv6 packet. This flaw occurs because the addition of 0x100 to the Offset variable is truncated to a UINT8, resulting in an unmodified Offset. As a consequence of this infinite loop, the affected computer never finishes booting up.",
