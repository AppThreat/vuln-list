Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle \u0026 Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

  "details": [
    "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.1378.",
    "A flaw was found in Vim. There is an incorrect calculation of buffer size issue found in Vim's yank_copy_line() function of the register.c file. This flaw allows illegal memory access when using virtual editing as \"startspaces\" goes negative. An attacker can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an issue that causes an application to crash leading to a denial of service, corrupting memory, and possibly executing code."
