    "GStreamer MXF File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of MXF video files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-21660.",
    "A heap-buffer overflow flaw was found in the MXF file demuxer in the GStreamer Plugins Bad when handling malformed files with an uncompressed video. This issue requires user interaction with the library, and could allow a malicious user to cause an integer overflow before allocating the buffer, triggering a crash or code execution via heap manipulation, executing code in the context of the current process."
