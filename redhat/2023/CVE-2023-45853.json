  "name": "CVE-2023-45853",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib product. NOTE: pyminizip through 0.2.6 is also vulnerable because it bundles an affected zlib version, and exposes the applicable MiniZip code through its compress API.",
    "A flaw was found in the MiniZip component of the zlib package. When opening a new file, MiniZip doesn't properly validate the filename, comments, or extra fields length against the data type used to store this information. This may allow an attacker to craft a malicious ZIP file that will lead to an overflow on the length field. This value is further used in memory allocations and indexing, which can cause an out-of-bounds write, leading to heap corruption and possible arbitrary code execution."
