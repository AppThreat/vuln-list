  "statement": "All versions of Vim shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are affected, because of the presence of vulnerable code in our code-base.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact, because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle \u0026 Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

  "details": [
    "Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
