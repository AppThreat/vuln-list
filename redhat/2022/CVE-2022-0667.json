  "details": [
    "When the vulnerability is triggered the BIND process will exit. BIND 9.18.0",
    "An assertion check flaw was found in BIND, with a refactoration of recursive client code that introduced a \"backstop lifetime timer.\" While BIND processes a request for a DS record that needs to be forwarded, it waits until this processing is complete or until the backstop lifetime timer has timed out. As a result of this timeout, the resume_dslookup() function is called, which does not test whether the fetch has shut down previously. This issue triggers an assertion failure, which could cause the BIND process to terminate."
