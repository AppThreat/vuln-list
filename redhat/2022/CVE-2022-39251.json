  "name": "CVE-2022-39251",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0, matrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.",
    "A flaw was found in Mozilla. According to the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory, Thunderbird users who use the Matrix chat protocol are vulnerable to an impersonation attack. An attacker could spoof historical messages from other users, and use a malicious key backup to the user's account under specific conditions in order to exfiltrate message keys."
