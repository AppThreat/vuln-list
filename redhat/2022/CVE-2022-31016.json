    "Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. Argo CD versions v0.7.0 and later are vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory consumption bug, allowing an authorized malicious user to crash the repo-server service, resulting in a Denial of Service. The attacker must be an authenticated Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. The fix for this vulnerability is available in versions 2.3.5, 2.2.10, 2.1.16, and later. There are no known workarounds. Users are recommended to upgrade.",
    "A flaw was found in ArgoCD, which is vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory consumption bug. A crafted manifest file can lead the ArgoCD's repo-server component to crash, causing a denial of service. The attacker must be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability."
