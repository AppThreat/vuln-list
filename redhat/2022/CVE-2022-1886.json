    "Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.",
    "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Vim's utf_head_off() function in the mbyte.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service and possibly some amount of memory leak."
