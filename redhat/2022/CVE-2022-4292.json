    "Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0882.",
    "A heap use-after-free flaw was found in Vim's did_set_spelllang() function of the spell.c file. This issue occurs because vim uses freed memory after SpellFileMissing autocmd uses bwipe. This could allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free issue that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
