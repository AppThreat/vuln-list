    "FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing input validation in `urbdrc` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to crash with division by zero. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0. All users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `/usb` redirection switch.",
    "A division-by-zero issue was found in FreeRDP's libusb_udevice.c in the urbdrc channel. This flaw exists due to missing input validation in the urbdrc channel. A malicious server can pass specially crafted data to the client, causing a crash and denial of service."
