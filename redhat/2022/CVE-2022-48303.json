  "details": [
    "GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump. Exploitation to change the flow of control has not been demonstrated. The issue occurs in from_header in list.c via a V7 archive in which mtime has approximately 11 whitespace characters.",
    "A flaw was found in the Tar package. When attempting to read files with old V7 tar format with a specially crafted checksum, an invalid memory read may occur. An attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information or cause a crash."
