Garbage collection and pruning in git is also recommended.\nOrganizations should not analyze regular cloned copies (without the “–mirror” option) since that may provide a false sense of security, and should not rely on methods of removing secrets such as deleting a branch or rewinding history via the “git reset” command.",

  "name": "CVE-2022-24975",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\" issue. This could present a security risk if information-disclosure auditing processes rely on a clone operation without the --mirror option. Note: This has been disputed by multiple 3rd parties who believe this is an intended feature of the git binary and does not pose a security risk.",
    "A flaw known as \"GitBleed\" was found in Git, where repositories cloned via the \"–mirror\" option may leak secrets or sensitive information if not properly removed/deleted earlier. This flaw allows attackers and bug bounty hunters to use this discrepancy in Git behavior to find hidden secrets and other sensitive data in public repositories."
