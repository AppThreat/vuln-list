  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).",
    "A flaw was found in rsync that is triggered by a victim rsync user/client connecting to a malicious rsync server. The server can copy and overwrite arbitrary files in the client's rsync target directory and subdirectories. This flaw allows a malicious server, or in some cases, another attacker who performs a man-in-the-middle attack, to potentially overwrite sensitive files on the client machine, resulting in further exploitation."
