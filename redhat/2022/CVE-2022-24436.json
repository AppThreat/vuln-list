  "mitigation": "Currently, there is no mitigation for this flaw. Intel has provided some guidance to developers of Cryptographic software to harden their libraries and applications against Hertzbleed. More information is available in the official Intel and AMD security advisories linked at the bottom of this document.\nA workload-independent workaround to mitigate Hertzbleed is to disable frequency boost. However, this is not recommended since it will significantly affect performance.\nReference:\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/frequency-throttling-side-channel-guidance.html",
