  "details": [
    "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.",
    "A vulnerability was found in freerdp. This flaw occurs when the server-side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. This issue exposes an improper authenticating vulnerability."
