    "Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0225.",
    "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim in the find_var_also_in_script function in the evalvars.c file. This issue occurs because an already freed memory is used when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the use-after-free, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
