Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.",

    "Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.",
    "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Vim's inc() function of misc2.c. This issue occurs because Vim reads beyond the end of the line with a put command. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds read that causes a crash in the CLI tool."
