    "An attacker can leverage this flaw to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources. Upon restart the attacker would have to begin again, but nevertheless there is the potential to deny service.",
    "A flaw was found in the Bind package, where a flaw in ‘named’ can cause a small memory leak in key processing when using TKEY records in Diffie-Hellman mode with OpenSSL 3.0.0 and later versions. This flaw allows an attacker to gradually erode available memory to the point where ‘named’ crashes due to a lack of resources."
