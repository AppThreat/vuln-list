    "Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0260.",
    "A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's qf_fill_buffer() function of the src/quickfix.c file. The issue occurs because vim uses freed memory when recursively using 'quickfixtextfunc.' This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
