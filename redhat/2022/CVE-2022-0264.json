  "mitigation": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.",

    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF verifier when handling internal data structures. Internal memory locations could be returned to userspace. A local attacker with the permissions to insert eBPF code to the kernel can use this to leak internal kernel memory details defeating some of the exploit mitigations in place for the kernel.
