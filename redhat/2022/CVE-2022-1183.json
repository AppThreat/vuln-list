  "statement": "This flaw only affects BIND 9.18.0 -\u003e 9.18.2 and BIND 9.19.0, whereas Red Hat ships BIND-9.16 and lower versions. Therefore, versions of BIND shipped with Red Hat Products are not affected by this flaw.\nFor RHEL-9, DHCP uses BIND 9 libraries (bind-9.11.x) for some services. Hence, DHCP shipped with RHEL-9 is also not affected.",

  "name": "CVE-2022-1183",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "On vulnerable configurations, the named daemon may, in some circumstances, terminate with an assertion failure. Vulnerable configurations are those that include a reference to http within the listen-on statements in their named.conf. TLS is used by both DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH), but configurations using DoT alone are unaffected. Affects BIND 9.18.0 -\u003e 9.18.2 and version 9.19.0 of the BIND 9.19 development branch.",
    "A flaw was found in BIND due to a reachable assertion triggered if a TLS connection to a configured HTTP TLS listener with a defined endpoint is destroyed too early. This flaw allows a remote attacker to trigger a denial of service condition on the targeted system."
