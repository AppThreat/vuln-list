  "details": [
    "heap buffer overflow in get_one_sourceline in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4647.",
    "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's get_one_sourceline() function of scriptfile.c file. This flaw occurs when \"source\" can read past the end of the copied line. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow and causing an application to crash, which leads to a denial of service."
