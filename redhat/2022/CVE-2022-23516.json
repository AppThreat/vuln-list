  "details": [
    "Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML documents and fragments, built on top of Nokogiri. Loofah \u003e= 2.2.0, \u003c 2.19.1 uses recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError exception.  This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue is patched in version 2.19.1. Users who are unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings that are sanitized.",
    "An uncontrolled recursion vulnerability was found in rubygem loofah. While sanitizing certain sections, loofah is susceptible to stack exhaustion, which can result in a denial of service through CPU resource consumption."
