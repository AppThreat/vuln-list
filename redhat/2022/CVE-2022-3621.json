  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component nilfs2. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211920.",
    "A flaw was found in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. If the i_mode field in inode of the metadata files is corrupted on the disk, it can cause the initialization of the bmap structure not being called, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference at nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level. A user permitted to mount arbitrary file system images could use this flaw to cause a denial of service."
