Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle \u0026 Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Buffer Over-read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.",
    "A heap buffer over-read vulnerability was found in Vim's put_on_cmdline() function of the src/ex_getln.c file. This issue occurs due to invalid memory access when using an expression on the command line. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory."
