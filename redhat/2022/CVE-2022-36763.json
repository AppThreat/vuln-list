  "details": [
    "EDK2 is susceptible to a vulnerability in the Tcg2MeasureGptTable() function, allowing a user to trigger a heap buffer overflow via a local network. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability.",
    "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found via the Tcg2MeasureGptTable() function in EDK2, arising from inadequate validation of the GPT Primary Header, presenting a minor risk to confidentiality and integrity. The primary consequence is likely a crash or denial of service. This issue may allow a local attacker to craft a GPT table, causing an integer overflow and consequent buffer overflow."
