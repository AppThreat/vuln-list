  "details": [
    "libdwarf 0.4.1 has a double free in _dwarf_exec_frame_instr in dwarf_frame.c.",
    "A double-free vulnerability was found in libdwarf's dwarf_expand_frame_instructions() function of the dwarf_frame.c file. A carefully crafted object file could cause the â€˜dwarfdump' utility to do a double free in handling an error condition. This issue could cause a segmentation violation or other major error, terminating the calling application and resulting in a denial of service."
