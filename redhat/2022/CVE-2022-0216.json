    "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter emulation of QEMU. The flaw occurs while processing repeated messages to cancel the current SCSI request via the lsi_do_msgout function. This flaw allows a malicious privileged user within the guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.",
