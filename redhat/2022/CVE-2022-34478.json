The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of the `ms-msdt`, `search`, and `search-ms` protocols delivering content to Microsoft applications and bypassing the browser when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Firefox), so in this release, Firefox has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them."
