  "details": [
    "In Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and older unsupported versions, when using routing functionality it is possible for a user to provide a specially crafted SpEL as a routing-expression that may result in remote code execution and access to local resources.",
    "A flaw was found in Spring Cloud Function via the spring.cloud.function.routing-expression header that is modified by the attacker to contain malicious expression language code. The attacker is able to call functions that should not normally be accessible, including runtime exec calls."
