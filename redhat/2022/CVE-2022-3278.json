    "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Vim's eval_next_non_blank() function of the src/eval.c file. The flaw occurs when using NUL in buffer uses :source. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a NULL pointer dereference that causes a denial of service."
