    "Jenkins Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2689.v434009a_31b_f1 and earlier allows loading any Groovy source files on the classpath of Jenkins and Jenkins plugins in sandboxed pipelines.",
    "A flaw was found in Jenkins Groovy Plugin. The plugin allows pipelines to load Groovy source files. The intent is to allow Global Shared Libraries to execute without sandbox protection. The issue is that the plugin allows any Groovy source files bundled with Jenkins core and plugins to be loaded this way and their methods executed. If a suitable Groovy source file is available on the classpath of Jenkins, sandbox protections can be bypassed. No Groovy source files were found in Jenkins core or plugins that could result in attackers executing dangerous code; hence successful exploitation is considered highly unlikely."
