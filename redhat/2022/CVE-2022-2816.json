    "Out-of-bounds Read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0212.",
    "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in Vim in the check_vim9_unlet function in the vim9cmds.c file. This issue occurs because of invalid memory access when compiling the unlet command when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the out-of-bounds read, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
