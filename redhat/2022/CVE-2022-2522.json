    "Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0061.",
    "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in vim's ins_compl_infercase_gettext() function of the src/insexpand.c file. This flaw occurs when vim tries to access uninitialized memory when completing a long line. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap-based buffer overflow that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
