    "Stack-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0598.",
    "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Vim's win_redr_ruler() function of the src/drawscreen.c file. The issue occurs when using a negative array index with a negative width window. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, which triggers the bug, causing an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
