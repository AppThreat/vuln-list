    "Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.",
    "A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim's skipwhite() function of the src/charset.c file. This flaw occurs because of an uninitialized attribute value and freed memory in the spell command. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory."
