    "Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0286.",
    "A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's get_next_valid_entry() function of the src/quickfix.c file. The issue occurs because vim is using freed memory when the location list is changed in autocmd. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
