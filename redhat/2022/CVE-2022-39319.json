    "FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing input length validation in the `urbdrc` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `/usb` redirection switch.",
    "An out-of-bound read vulnerability was discovered in FreeRDP due to improper input length validation in client/data_transfer.c in the urbdrc channel. A malicious server can trigger an out-of-bounds read by tricking a FreeRDP based client to read out-of-bound data and send it back to the server."
