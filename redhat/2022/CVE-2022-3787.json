This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 or earlier, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0, as previously released fixes for CVE-2022-41974 were not regressed in those versions.\nFor more details about the original security issue CVE-2022-41974, refer to the CVE page: https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-41974.",

  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in the device-mapper-multipath. The device-mapper-multipath allows local users to obtain root access, exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users that are able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This issue occurs because an attacker can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled when arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR. This could lead to local privilege escalation to root.",
