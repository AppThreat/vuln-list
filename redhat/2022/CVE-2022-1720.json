Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle \u0026 Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Buffer Over-read in function grab_file_name in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4956. This vulnerability is capable of crashing the software, memory modification, and possible remote execution.",
    "A heap buffer over-read vulnerability was found in Vim's grab_file_name() function of the src/findfile.c file. This flaw occurs because the function reads after the NULL terminates the line with \"gf\" in Visual block mode. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer over-read vulnerability that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory."
