  "details": [
    "BIND 9.16.11 -\u003e 9.16.26, 9.17.0 -\u003e 9.18.0 and versions 9.16.11-S1 -\u003e 9.16.26-S1 of the BIND Supported Preview Edition. Specifically crafted TCP streams can cause connections to BIND to remain in CLOSE_WAIT status for an indefinite period of time, even after the client has terminated the connection.",
    "A flaw was found in Bind that incorrectly handles certain crafted TCP streams. The vulnerability allows TCP connection slots to be consumed for an indefinite time frame via a specifically crafted TCP stream sent from a client. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted TCP streams with 'keep-response-order' enabled that could cause connections to BIND to remain in CLOSE_WAIT status for an indefinite period, even after the client has terminated the connection. This issue results in BIND consuming resources, leading to a denial of service."
