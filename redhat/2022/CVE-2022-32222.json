  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A cryptographic vulnerability exists on Node.js on linux in versions of 18.x prior to 18.40.0 which allowed a default path for openssl.cnf that might be accessible under some circumstances to a non-admin user instead of /etc/ssl as was the case in versions prior to the upgrade to OpenSSL 3.",
    "A vulnerability was found in NodeJS. The issue occurs when Node.js starts on Linux based systems and attempts to read /home/iojs/build/ws/out/Release/obj.target/deps/openssl/openssl.cnf, which ordinarily does not exist. This flaw allows an attacker on some shared systems to create this file and affect the default OpenSSL configuration for other users."
