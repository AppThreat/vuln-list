  "statement": "The identified flaw in ImageMagick, presenting a \"Missing Release of Memory\" vulnerability triggered by the 'identify -help' command, carries a moderate severity rating due to its potential impact on system stability and resource consumption. While the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service condition by inducing memory leaks, its exploitation requires specific user interaction with the affected command. Furthermore, successful exploitation does not inherently grant unauthorized access or execution of arbitrary code. However, in scenarios where the affected command is publicly accessible or invoked frequently, such as in web applications processing user-uploaded images, the risk of exploitation and consequent disruption to service availability elevates.",

  "details": [
    "A memory leak in ImageMagick 7.0.10-45 and 6.9.11-22 allows remote attackers to perform a denial of service via the \"identify -help\" command.",
    "A flaw was found in ImageMagick, which susceptible to a Missing Release of Memory after the Effective Lifetime vulnerability is triggered by the 'identify -help' command. This issue could allow an attacker to initiate a denial of service attack by inducing a memory leak."
