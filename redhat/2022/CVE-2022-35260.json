    "curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.",
    "A vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when curl is told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends in a line with consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl could read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the read works, it can write a zero byte beyond its boundary. This issue, in most cases, causes a segfault or similar problem. A denial of service can occur if a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents."
