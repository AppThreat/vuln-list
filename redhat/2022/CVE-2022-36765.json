  "details": [
    "EDK2 is susceptible to a vulnerability in the CreateHob() function, allowing a user to trigger a integer overflow to buffer overflow via a local network. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability.",
    "A flaw was found in the CreateHob() function in EDK2. An attacker, leveraging a local network, can initiate an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow. This issue arises during size alignment within the CreateHob() function, requiring activation in the PEI phase. Successful exploitation of this flaw poses a moderate threat to confidentiality and integrity, however, the primary consequence is likely a crash or denial of service."
