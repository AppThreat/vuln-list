    "Heap-based Buffer Overflow occurs in vim in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4563.",
    "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's suggest_try_change() function of the spellsuggest.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow and causing an application to crash, which leads to a denial of service."
