    "Insufficient Granularity of Access Control in an OpenShift router causes improper subdomain ownership verification, allowing route takeover. Once a custom route is created, the user must update the DNS provider by creating a canonical name (CNAME) record to expose this route externally. The CNAME record should point the custom domain to the OpenShift router as the alias. If the CNAME is not removed when the route is not in use anymore, there is a dangling route that a malicious actor may take over."
