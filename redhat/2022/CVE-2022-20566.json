  "mitigation": "The only way to mitigate these vulnerabilities on the operating system level is to disable the Bluetooth functionality via blacklisting kernel modules in the Linux kernel. The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. How to disable Bluetooth modules instructions are available on the Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931.\nAlternatively, Bluetooth can be disabled within the hardware or at BIOS level, which will also provide an effective mitigation as the kernel will not be able to detect that Bluetooth hardware is present on the system.",
