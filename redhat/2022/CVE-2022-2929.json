  "details": [
    "In ISC DHCP 1.0 -\u003e 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -\u003e 4.1-ESV-R16-P1 a system with access to a DHCP server, sending DHCP packets crafted to include fqdn labels longer than 63 bytes, could eventually cause the server to run out of memory.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the DHCP server where the \"fqdn_universe_decode()\" function allocates buffer space for the contents of option 81 (fqdn) data received in a DHCP packet. The maximum length of a DNS \"label\" is 63 bytes. The function tests the length byte of each label contained in the \"fqdn\"; if it finds a label whose length byte value is larger than 63, it returns without dereferencing the buffer space. This issue causes a memory leak. On a system with access to a DHCP server, an attacker from any adjacent network could send DHCP packets crafted to include \"fqdn\" labels longer than 63 bytes to the DHCP server, eventually causing the server to run out of memory and crash."
