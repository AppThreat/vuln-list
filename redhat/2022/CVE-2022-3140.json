    "LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In the affected versions of LibreOffice links using that scheme could be constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Which when clicked on, or activated by document events, could result in arbitrary script execution without warning. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.1; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.6.",
    "A vulnerability was found in LibreOffice that affects the Office URI Schemes. These schemes enable browser integration of LibreOffice with the MS SharePoint server. In LibreOffice, the links using the scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' could be constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments, which, when clicked, or activated by document events, could result in arbitrary script execution without warning. The attacker must trick the targeted individual into opening a malicious file to trigger the exploit."
