  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Apache Pulsar. Due to missing authentication checking, unauthenticated users can connect to the `/proxy-stats` endpoint. This endpoint exposes confidential information about the deployment and may allow the attacker to increase the logging level. As a result, the attacker may have information about IP addresses connected to the service. Additionally, it may lead to a denial Of service when the logging level is increased."
