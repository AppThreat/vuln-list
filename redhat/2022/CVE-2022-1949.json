    "An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base. That mishandling of the filter that would yield incorrect results, but as that has progressed, can be determined that it actually is an access control bypass. This may allow any remote unauthenticated user to issue a filter that allows searching for database items they do not have access to, including but not limited to potentially userPassword hashes and other sensitive data.",
    "A flaw was found in the 389-ds-base package where some LDAP queries can cause performance issues. This flaw allows an attacker to send a non-optimal search that causes serious performance issues within the directory server."
