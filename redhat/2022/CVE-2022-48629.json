    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ncrypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled\nThe generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destination\nbuffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()\ncan run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled with\nrandomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed since\nqcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue can\nbe reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:\nkcapi-rng -b 9000000 \u003e OUTFILE\nThe generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all\nzeros, and this is caused by the code where the test\n'val \u0026 PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.\nLet's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns\nwith a full buffer if the function returns success. Let's also have\nqcom_rng_generate() return the correct value.\nHere's some statistics from the ent project\n(https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about the\nquality of the generated numbers:\n$ ent -c qcom-random-before\nValue Char Occurrences Fraction\n0           606748   0.067416\n1            33104   0.003678\n2            33001   0.003667\n...\n253   �        32883   0.003654\n254   �        33035   0.003671\n255   �        33239   0.003693\nTotal:       9000000   1.000000\nEntropy = 7.811590 bits per byte.\nOptimum compression would reduce the size\nof this 9000000 byte file by 2 percent.\nChi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 9329962.81, and\nrandomly would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the\ntimes.\nArithmetic mean value of data bytes is 119.3731 (127.5 = random).\nMonte Carlo value for Pi is 3.197293333 (error 1.77 percent).\nSerial correlation coefficient is 0.159130 (totally uncorrelated =\n0.0).\nWithout this patch, the results of the chi-square test is 0.01%, and\nthe numbers are certainly not random according to ent's project page.\nThe results improve with this patch:\n$ ent -c qcom-random-after\nValue Char Occurrences Fraction\n0            35432   0.003937\n1            35127   0.003903\n2            35424   0.003936\n...\n253   �        35201   0.003911\n254   �        34835   0.003871\n255   �        35368   0.003930\nTotal:       9000000   1.000000\nEntropy = 7.999979 bits per byte.\nOptimum compression would reduce the size\nof this 9000000 byte file by 0 percent.\nChi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 258.77, and randomly\nwould exceed this value 42.24 percent of the times.\nArithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5006 (127.5 = random).\nMonte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141277333 (error 0.01 percent).\nSerial correlation coefficient is 0.000468 (totally uncorrelated =\n0.0).\nThis change was tested on a Nexus 5 phone (msm8974 SoC)."
