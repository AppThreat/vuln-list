  "statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker would need to convince a user to extract an archive (tar, zip, etc) containing a LibreOffice document and a specific file with Java code inside it, and then the user would need to open the LibreOffice document normally. As user interaction is required to open an unstrusted file, this flaw was rated with a moderate security impact.",
