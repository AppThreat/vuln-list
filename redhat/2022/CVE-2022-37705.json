  "details": [
    "A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),",
    "A flaw was found in Amanda. The `runtar` SUID binary executes /usr/bin/tar as root without properly validating its arguments, possibly leading to escalation of privileges from the regular user \"amandabackup\" to root."
