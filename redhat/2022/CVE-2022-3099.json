    "Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0360.",
    "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's do_cmdline() function of the src/ex_docmd.c file. The issue triggers when an invalid line number on :for is ignored. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
