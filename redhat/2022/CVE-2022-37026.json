  "statement": "Some releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform ship an affected version of the Erlang libraries, however RHOSP is configured to use application-level shared secret authentication during TLS sessions. This makes it unlikely to be exploitable as none of the vulnerable codepaths are exposed and no client certificate is used for authentication. For this reason the impact to Red Hat OpenStack Platform has been downgraded to Moderate.",
