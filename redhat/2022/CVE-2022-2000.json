Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.",

  "details": [
    "Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.",
    "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in Vim's append_command() function of the src/ex_docmd.c file. This issue occurs when an error for a command goes over the end of IObuff. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash and corrupt memory."
