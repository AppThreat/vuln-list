  "mitigation": "Removal of the private key from the ConfigMap, or modification of the RBAC permissions is not a sufficient mitigation on its own, as these will both be restored by the authentication-operator.\nThis flaw can be mitigated by deploying a custom webhook which filters out the private key from the target ConfigMap, preventing it from being restored by the authentication-operator. An example of this can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/sfowl/configmap-cleaner\nAfter upgrading to a fixed version of OpenShift or applying the mitigation, all ingress certificates should be rotated:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/security/certificates/replacing-default-ingress-certificate.html#replacing-default-ingress",
