  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992.",
    "A flaw was found in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. If the beginning of the inode bitmap area was corrupted on disk, an inode with the same inode number as the root inode could be allocated and fail soon after. The subsequent call to nilfs_clear_inode() wrongly decremented the reference counter of struct nilfs_root, leading to a use-after-free issue. A user permitted to mount arbitrary file system images could use this flaw to cause a denial of service."
