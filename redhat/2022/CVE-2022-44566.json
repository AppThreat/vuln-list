  "details": [
    "A denial of service vulnerability present in ActiveRecord's PostgreSQL adapter \u003c7.0.4.1 and \u003c6.1.7.1. When a value outside the range for a 64bit signed integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter, it will treat the target column type as numeric. Comparing integer values against numeric values can result in a slow sequential scan resulting in potential Denial of Service.",
    "A flaw was found in the rubygem-activerecord. RubyGem's ActiveRecord is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a flaw in the PostgreSQL adapter. By sending a specially-crafted request, a remote attacker can cause a slow sequential scan, resulting in a denial of service."
