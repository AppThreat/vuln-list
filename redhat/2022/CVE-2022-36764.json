  "details": [
    "EDK2 is susceptible to a vulnerability in the Tcg2MeasurePeImage() function, allowing a user to trigger a heap buffer overflow via a local network. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found via the Tcg2MeasurePeImage() function in EDK2. Successful exploitation requires a local attacker to trigger an integer overflow in the calculation of the EventSize variable at DxeTpm2MeasureBootLib.c, leading to the heap-buffer overflow, presenting a moderate risk to confidentiality and integrity. However, the primary consequence is likely a crash or denial of service."
