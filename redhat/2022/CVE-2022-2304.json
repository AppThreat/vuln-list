    "Stack-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.",
    "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Vim's spell_dump_compl() function of the src/spell.c file. This issue occurs because the spell dump goes beyond the end of an array when crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds write that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
