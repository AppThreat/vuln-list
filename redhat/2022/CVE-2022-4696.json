  "details": [
    "There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won't use current-\u003ensproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function which will use current-\u003ensproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the io_uring subsystem of the Linux kernel. This issue occurs during the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation due to a missing IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, leading to an invalid decrease of its reference counter and later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system."
