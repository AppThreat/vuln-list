  "details": [
    "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability.",
    "A flaw was found in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. If nilfs_attach_log_writer() failed to create a log writer thread, it free'd a data structure of the log writer without any cleanup, causing a leak of struct nilfs_root. A user permitted to mount arbitrary file system images could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion)."
