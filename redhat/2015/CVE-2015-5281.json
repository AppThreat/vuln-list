  "details": [
    "The grub2 package before 2.02-0.29 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, when used on UEFI systems, allows local users to bypass intended Secure Boot restrictions and execute non-verified code via a crafted (1) multiboot or (2) multiboot2 module in the configuration file or physically proximate attackers to bypass intended Secure Boot restrictions and execute non-verified code via the (3) boot menu.",
    "It was discovered that grub2 builds for EFI systems contained modules that were not suitable to be loaded in a Secure Boot environment. An attacker could use this flaw to circumvent the Secure Boot mechanisms and load non-verified code. Attacks could use the boot menu if no password was set, or the grub2 configuration file if the attacker has root privileges on the system."
