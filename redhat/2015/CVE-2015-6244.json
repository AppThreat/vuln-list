  "mitigation": "This flaw can be mitigated in wireshark by disabling the ZigBee protocol dissector. In wireshark GUI application click on Analyze-\u003eEnabled Protocols and search for \"ZigBee\" and disable in. When using \"tshark\", the text interface, create a file called \"disabled_protos\" in the preferences folder (normally .wireshark folder in the home directory of the user running wireshark) and add \"ZigBee\" to it. This should disable the ZigBee protocol.",
