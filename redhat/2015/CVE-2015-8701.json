  "details": [
    "QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the Rocker switch emulation support is vulnerable to an off-by-one error. It happens while processing transmit (tx) descriptors in 'tx_consume' routine, if a descriptor was to have more than allowed (ROCKER_TX_FRAGS_MAX=16) fragments. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause memory leakage on the host or crash the QEMU process instance resulting in DoS issue.",
