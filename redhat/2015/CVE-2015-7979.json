  "details": [
    "NTP before 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.x before 4.3.90 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client-server association tear down) by sending broadcast packets with invalid authentication to a broadcast client.",
    "It was found that when NTP was configured in broadcast mode, a remote attacker could broadcast packets with bad authentication to all clients. The clients, upon receiving the malformed packets, would break the association with the broadcast server, causing them to become out of sync over a longer period of time."
