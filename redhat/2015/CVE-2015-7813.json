  "mitigation": "The problematic log messages are issued with priority Warning.\nTherefore they can be rate limited by adding \"loglvl=error/warning\" to the hypervisor command line or suppressed entirely by adding \"loglvl=error\".\nOn systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which do not call these hypercalls will also prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.",
