  "name": "CVE-2015-3214",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The pit_ioport_read in i8254.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33 and QEMU before 2.3.1 does not distinguish between read lengths and write lengths, which might allow guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS by triggering use of an invalid index.",
    "An out-of-bounds memory access flaw, leading to memory corruption or possibly an information leak, was found in QEMU's pit_ioport_read() function. A privileged guest user in a QEMU guest, which had QEMU PIT emulation enabled, could potentially, in rare cases, use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process."
