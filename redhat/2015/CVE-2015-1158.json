  "statement": "This issue affects the version of cups package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle.

  "name": "CVE-2015-1158",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 2.0.3 performs incorrect free operations for multiple-value job-originating-host-name attributes, which allows remote attackers to trigger data corruption for reference-counted strings via a crafted (1) IPP_CREATE_JOB or (2) IPP_PRINT_JOB request, as demonstrated by replacing the configuration file and consequently executing arbitrary code.",
    "A string reference count bug was found in cupsd, causing premature freeing of string objects. An attacker could submit a malicious print job that exploits this flaw to dismantle ACLs protecting privileged operations, allowing a replacement configuration file to be uploaded, which in turn allowed the attacker to run arbitrary code on the CUPS server."
