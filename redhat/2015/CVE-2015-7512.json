  "statement": "This issue does not affect the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they do not enable the pcnet backend driver.\nThis issue does not affect the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 based versions of the qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\nThis issue affects the versions of the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 based versions of qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3. Future updates for the respective releases may address this flaw.\nPlease note that AMD PCNet adapter has to be explicitly enabled per-guest as it is not enabled in default configuration and is not supported by Red Hat in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (for a list of supported devices please consult https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Administration_Guide/sect-whitelist-device-options.html).\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and\nmaintenance life cycle. Though this has been rated as having Important security\nimpact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

  "name": "CVE-2015-7512",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Buffer overflow in the pcnet_receive function in hw/net/pcnet.c in QEMU, when a guest NIC has a larger MTU, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or execute arbitrary code via a large packet.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PC-Net II emulation validated certain received packets from a remote host in non-loopback mode. A remote, unprivileged attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process. Note that to exploit this flaw, the guest network interface must have a large MTU limit."
