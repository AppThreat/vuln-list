  "details": [
    "The (1) mod_dav_svn and (2) svnserve servers in Subversion 1.6.0 through 1.7.19 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.11 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and abort) via crafted parameter combinations related to dynamically evaluated revision numbers.",
    "An assertion failure flaw was found in the way the SVN server processed certain requests with dynamically evaluated revision numbers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the SVN server (both svnserve and httpd with the mod_dav_svn module) to crash."
