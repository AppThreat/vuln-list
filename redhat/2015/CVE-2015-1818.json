    "XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the dashbuilder import facility (DocumentBuilders in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl) in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite before 6.1.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, and have other unspecified impact via a crafted XML document.",
    "A flaw was found in the dashbuilder import facility: the DocumentBuilders instantiated in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl did not disable external entities. This could allow an attacker to perform a variety of XML External Entity (XXE) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks."
