  "details": [
    "Buffer overflow in the set_cs_start function in t1disasm.c in t1utils before 1.39 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way t1utils processed, for example, certain PFB (Printer Font Binary) files. An attacker could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into processing a specially crafted PFB file with t1utils."
