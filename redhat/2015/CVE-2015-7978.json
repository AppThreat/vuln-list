    "NTP before 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.0 before 4.3.90 allows a remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion) via an ntpdc relist command, which triggers recursive traversal of the restriction list.",
    "A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd."
