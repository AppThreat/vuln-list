  "details": [
    "The C+ mode offload emulation in the RTL8139 network card device model in QEMU, as used in Xen 4.5.x and earlier, allows remote attackers to read process heap memory via unspecified vectors.",
    "An information leak flaw was found in the way QEMU's RTL8139 emulation implementation processed network packets under RTL8139 controller's C+ mode of operation. An unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to read up to 65 KB of uninitialized QEMU heap memory."
