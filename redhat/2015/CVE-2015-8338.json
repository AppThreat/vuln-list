  "details": [
    "Xen 4.6.x and earlier does not properly enforce limits on page order inputs for the (1) XENMEM_increase_reservation, (2) XENMEM_populate_physmap, (3) XENMEM_exchange, and possibly other HYPERVISOR_memory_op suboperations, which allows ARM guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption, guest reboot, or watchdog timeout and host reboot) and possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.",
    "A flaw was discovered in xen host that prevented the use of a physical CPU for a significant period of time. This can cause a softlockup or watchdog timeout in both the host and other guests."
