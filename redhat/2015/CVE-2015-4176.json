    "fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.0.2 does not properly support mount connectivity, which allows local users to read arbitrary files by leveraging user-namespace root access for deletion of a file or directory.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where the deletion of a file or directory could trigger an unmount and reveal data under a mount point. This flaw was inadvertently introduced with the new feature of being able to lazily unmount a mount tree when using file system user namespaces."
