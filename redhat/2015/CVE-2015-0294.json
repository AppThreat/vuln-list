  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "GnuTLS before 3.3.13 does not validate that the signature algorithms match when importing a certificate.",
    "It was discovered that GnuTLS did not check if all sections of X.509 certificates indicate the same signature algorithm. This flaw, in combination with a different flaw, could possibly lead to a bypass of the certificate signature check."
