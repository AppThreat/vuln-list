    "abrt-dbus in Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) allows local users to delete or change the ownership of arbitrary files via the problem directory argument to the (1) ChownProblemDir, (2) DeleteElement, or (3) DeleteProblem method.",
    "It was discovered that the abrt-dbus D-Bus service did not properly check the validity of the problem directory argument in the ChownProblemDir, DeleteElement, and DeleteProblem methods. A local attacker could use this flaw take ownership of arbitrary files and directories, or to delete files and directories as the root user."
