  "details": [
    "The ntpd client in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.x before 4.3.77 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a number of crafted \"KOD\" messages.",
    "It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check timestamps in Kiss-of-Death packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted Kiss-of-Death packet to an ntpd client that would increase the client's polling interval value, and effectively disable synchronization with the server."
