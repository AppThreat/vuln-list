  "name": "CVE-2015-5352",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The x11_open_helper function in channels.c in ssh in OpenSSH before 6.9, when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacks a check of the refusal deadline for X connections, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside of the permitted time window.",
    "It was found that the OpenSSH client did not properly enforce the ForwardX11Timeout setting. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested."
