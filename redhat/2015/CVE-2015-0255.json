    "X.Org Server (aka xserver and xorg-server) before 1.16.3 and 1.17.x before 1.17.1 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted string length value in a XkbSetGeometry request.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the X.Org server handled XkbGetGeometry requests. A malicious, authorized client could use this flaw to disclose portions of the X.Org server memory, or cause the X.Org server to crash using a specially crafted XkbGetGeometry request."
