  "name": "CVE-2015-1350",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The VFS subsystem in the Linux kernel 3.x provides an incomplete set of requirements for setattr operations that underspecifies removing extended privilege attributes, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (capability stripping) via a failed invocation of a system call, as demonstrated by using chown to remove a capability from the ping or Wireshark dumpcap program.",
    "It was found that a regular user could remove xattr permissions on files by using the chown or write system calls. A local attacker could use this flaw to deny elevated permissions from valid users, services, or applications, potentially resulting in a denial of service."
