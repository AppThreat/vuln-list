    "openpgpkey_61.c in named in ISC BIND 9.9.7 before 9.9.7-P3 and 9.10.x before 9.10.2-P4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit) via a crafted DNS response.",
    "A boundary check flaw was found in the way BIND parsed answers in certain DNS queries. A remote attacker able to provide a specially crafted response in an answer to a query could cause named functioning as a recursive resolver to crash."
