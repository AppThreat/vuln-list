  "details": [
    "The Identity Provider (IdP) server in Ipsilon 0.1.0 before 1.0.1 does not properly escape certain characters in a Python exception-message template, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an HTTP response.",
    "A flaw was discovered in the Ipsilon IdP server in its use of Python templates, where JavaScript code could potentially be injected into an Python exception-message template. A remote, unauthorised attacker could use this flaw to perform an XXS attack."
