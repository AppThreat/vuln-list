  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The __rds_conn_create function in net/rds/connection.c in the Linux kernel through 4.2.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by using a socket that was not properly bound.",
    "A NULL-pointer dereference vulnerability was discovered in the Linux kernel. The kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation did not verify that an underlying transport existed before creating a connection to a remote server.  A local system user could exploit this flaw to crash the system by creating sockets at specific times to trigger a NULL pointer dereference."
