  "details": [
    "libreport 2.0.7 before 2.6.3 only saves changes to the first file when editing a crash report, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors related to the (1) backtrace, (2) cmdline, (3) environ, (4) open_fds, (5) maps, (6) smaps, (7) hostname, (8) remote, (9) ks.cfg, or (10) anaconda-tb file attachment included in a Red Hat Bugzilla bug report.",
    "It was found that ABRT may have exposed non-public information to Red Hat Bugzilla during crash reporting. A bug in the libreport library caused changes made by a user in files included in a crash report to be discarded. As a result, Red Hat Bugzilla attachments may contain data that was not intended to be made public, including host names, IP addresses, or command line options."
