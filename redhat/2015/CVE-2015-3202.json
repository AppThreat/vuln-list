    "fusermount in FUSE before 2.9.3-15 does not properly clear the environment before invoking (1) mount or (2) umount as root, which allows local users to write to arbitrary files via a crafted LIBMOUNT_MTAB environment variable that is used by mount's debugging feature.",
    "It was discovered that fusermount failed to properly sanitize its environment before executing mount and umount commands. A local user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system."
