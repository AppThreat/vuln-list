  "details": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow in chrony before 1.31.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (chronyd crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by configuring the (1) NTP or (2) cmdmon access with a subnet size that is indivisible by four and an address with a nonzero bit in the subnet remainder.",
    "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way Chrony stored certain addresses when configuring NTP or cmdmon access. An attacker that has the command key and is allowed to access cmdmon (only localhost is allowed by default) could use this flaw to crash chronyd or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the chronyd process."
