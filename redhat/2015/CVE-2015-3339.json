  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Race condition in the prepare_binprm function in fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel before 3.19.6 allows local users to gain privileges by executing a setuid program at a time instant when a chown to root is in progress, and the ownership is changed but the setuid bit is not yet stripped.",
    "A race condition flaw was found between the chown and execve system calls. When changing the owner of a setuid user binary to root, the race condition could momentarily make the binary setuid root. A local, unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system."
