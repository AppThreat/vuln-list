  "details": [
    "Integer overflow in the _zip_cdir_new function in zip_dirent.c in libzip 0.11.2 and earlier, as used in the ZIP extension in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a ZIP archive that contains many entries, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way libzip, which is also embedded in PHP, processed certain ZIP archives. If an attacker were able to supply a specially crafted ZIP archive to an application using libzip, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code."
