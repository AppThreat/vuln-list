  "details": [
    "The PDF reader in Mozilla Firefox before 39.0.3, Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.1.1, and Firefox OS before 2.2 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy, and read arbitrary files or gain privileges, via vectors involving crafted JavaScript code and a native setter, as exploited in the wild in August 2015.",
    "A flaw was discovered in Mozilla Firefox that could be used to violate the same-origin policy and inject web script into a non-privileged part of the built-in PDF file viewer (PDF.js). An attacker could create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal arbitrary files (including private SSH keys, the /etc/passwd file, and other potentially sensitive files) from the system running Firefox."
