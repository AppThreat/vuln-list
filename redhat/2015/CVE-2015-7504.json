  "statement": "This issue does not affect the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they do not enable the pcnet backend driver.\nThis issue does not affect the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 based versions of the qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\nThis issue affects the versions of the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 based versions of qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3. Future updates for the respective releases may address this flaw.\nPlease note that AMD PCNet adapter has to be explicitly enabled per-guest as it is not enabled in default configuration and is not supported by Red Hat in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (for a list of supported devices please consult https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Administration_Guide/sect-whitelist-device-options.html).\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and\nmaintenance life cycle. Though this has been rated as having Important security\nimpact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

  "name": "CVE-2015-7504",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow in the pcnet_receive function in hw/net/pcnet.c in QEMU allows guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (instance crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a series of packets in loopback mode.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the way QEMU's AMD PC-Net II Ethernet Controller emulation\nreceived certain packets in loopback mode. A privileged user (with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability) inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the host QEMU process (resulting in denial of service) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with privileges of the host QEMU process."
