  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 does not reset the PIT counter values during state restoration, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and host OS crash) via a zero value, related to the kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit and kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit2 functions.",
    "A divide-by-zero flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel built with KVM virtualization support(CONFIG_KVM). The flaw occurs in the KVM module's Programmable Interval Timer(PIT) emulation, when PIT counters for channel 1 or 2 are set to zero(0) and a privileged user inside the guest attempts to read these counters. A privileged guest user with access to PIT I/O ports could exploit this issue to crash the host kernel (denial of service)."
