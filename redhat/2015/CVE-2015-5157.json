  "details": [
    "arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform mishandles IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution, which might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled IRET faults during the processing of NMIs. An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially (although highly unlikely), escalate their privileges on the system."
