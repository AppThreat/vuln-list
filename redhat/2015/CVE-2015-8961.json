  "details": [
    "The __ext4_journal_stop function in fs/ext4/ext4_jbd2.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.3 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging improper access to a certain error field.",
    "A flaw was found in the ext4 subsystem.  This vulnerability is a use after free vulnerability was found in __ext4_journal_stop(). Attackers could abuse this to allow any code which attempts to deal with the journal failure to be mishandled or not fail at all.  This could lead to data corruption or crashes."
