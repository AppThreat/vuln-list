    "SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly implement the dequoting of collation-sequence names, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted COLLATE clause, as demonstrated by COLLATE\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" at the end of a SELECT statement.",
    "A flaw was found in the way SQLite handled dequoting of collation-sequence names. A local attacker could submit a specially crafted COLLATE statement that would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts."
