  "name": "CVE-2015-7833",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The usbvision driver in the Linux kernel package 3.10.0-123.20.1.el7 through 3.10.0-229.14.1.el7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a nonzero bInterfaceNumber value in a USB device descriptor.",
    "An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the USBVision USB camera driver (usbvision_probe() function in drivers/media/usb/usbvision/usbvision-video.c). The driver assumes that the interfaces numbers of the USB device are always in 0,1,2,3... order. By using a specially crafted USB device which advertises an out-of-order number on one of its interfaces, an unprivileged user with physical access to the system can trigger a kernel NULL-pointer dereference causing a system freeze (denial of service)."
