  "details": [
    "fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c in the NFS client in the Linux kernel before 4.2.2 does not properly initialize memory for migration recovery operations, which allows remote NFS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) via crafted network traffic.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel: the NFSv4.2 migration code improperly initialized the kernel structure. A local, authenticated user could use this flaw to cause a panic of the NFS client (denial of service)."
