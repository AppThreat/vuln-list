    "This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority for the following reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not an exploitable issue. Notes: none.",
    "A flaw was found in how the OpenStack Compute (nova) service handles the qemu-img functionality during a snapshot upload. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this flaw to trick Compute into disclosing any file to which the Compute service user has access. However, it is unlikely that the code path can currently be exploited by an attacker."
