  "details": [
    "The Qpid server on Red Hat Satellite 6 does not properly restrict message types, which allows remote authenticated users with administrative access on a managed content host to execute arbitrary code via a crafted message, related to a pickle processing problem in pulp.",
    "A flaw was found in the handling of Python pickle()-encoded messages in the Qpid server on Satellite 6. The Qpid server did not properly restrict message types that can be sent from managed content hosts. An attacker with administrative access to a managed content host could send arbitrary messages containing pickle()-encoded data, which would then be processed on the Satellite 6 server and result in possible code execution."
