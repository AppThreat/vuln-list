  "details": [
    "The Human Monitor Interface support in QEMU allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and application crash).",
    "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability has been found in the QEMU emulator built with Human Monitor Interface(HMP) support. The issue occurs when the 'sendkey' command (in hmp_sendkey) is processed with a 'keyname_len' that is greater than the 'keyname_buf' array size. A user or process could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance (denial of service)."
