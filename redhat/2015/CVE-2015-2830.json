  "details": [
    "arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 3.19.2 does not prevent the TS_COMPAT flag from reaching a user-mode task, which might allow local users to bypass the seccomp or audit protection mechanism via a crafted application that uses the (1) fork or (2) close system call, as demonstrated by an attack against seccomp before 3.16.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation implementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry. A local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system."
