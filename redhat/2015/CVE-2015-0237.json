  "details": [
    "Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) Manager before 3.5.1 ignores the permission to deny snapshot creation during live storage migration between domains, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (prevent host start) by creating a long snapshot chain.",
    "It was discovered that the permissions to allow or deny snapshot creation were ignored during live storage migration of a VM's disk between storage domains. An attacker able to live migrate a disk between storage domains could use this flaw to cause a denial of service."
