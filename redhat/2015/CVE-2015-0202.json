  "statement": "Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of subversion as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 as they did not include support for additional level of caching for the DAG nodes, which cause excessive memory use due to the cached nodes not being deallocated in a timely manner.",

  "details": [
    "The mod_dav_svn server in Subversion 1.8.0 through 1.8.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of REPORT requests, which trigger the traversal of FSFS repository nodes."
