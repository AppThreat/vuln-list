    "The nf_nat_redirect_ipv4 function in net/netfilter/nf_nat_redirect.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by sending certain IPv4 packets to an incompletely configured interface, a related issue to CVE-2003-1604.",
    "A NULL-pointer dereference vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's TCP stack, in net/netfilter/nf_nat_redirect.c in the nf_nat_redirect_ipv4() function. A remote, unauthenticated user could exploit this flaw to create a system crash (denial of service)."
