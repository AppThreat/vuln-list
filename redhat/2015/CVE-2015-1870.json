  "details": [
    "The event scripts in Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) uses world-readable permission on a copy of sosreport file in problem directories, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from /var/log/messages via unspecified vectors.",
    "It was found that the ABRT event scripts created a user-readable copy of an sosreport file in ABRT problem directories, and included excerpts of /var/log/messages selected by the user-controlled process name, leading to an information disclosure. The fix for this issue prevents non-privileged users from accessing any crash reports, even reports of crashes of processes owned by those users. Only administrators (the wheel group members) are allowed to access crash reports via the \"System\" tab in the ABRT GUI, or by running abrt-cli as root (that is, via \"sudo abrt-cli\" or \"su -c abrt-cli\")."
