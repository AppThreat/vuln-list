  "details": [
    "The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during a risk-management decision for use of the alloca function, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation) or overwrite memory locations beyond the stack boundary via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.",
    "A stack overflow flaw was found in glibc's swscanf() function. An attacker able to make an application call the swscanf() function could use this flaw to crash that application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application."
