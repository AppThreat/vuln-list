  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The (1) pptp_bind and (2) pptp_connect functions in drivers/net/ppp/pptp.c in the Linux kernel through 4.3.3 do not verify an address length, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application.",
    "An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the kernel, where the length of the sockaddr parameter was not checked in the pptp_bind() and pptp_connect() functions. As a result, more kernel memory was copied out than required, leaking information from the kernel stack (including kernel addresses). A local system user could exploit this flaw to bypass kernel ASLR or leak other information."
