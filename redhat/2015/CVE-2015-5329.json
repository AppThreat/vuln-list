  "details": [
    "The TripleO Heat templates (tripleo-heat-templates), as used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0, do not properly use the configured RabbitMQ credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to services in deployed overclouds by leveraging knowledge of the default credentials.",
    "A flaw was found in the director (openstack-tripleo-heat-templates) where the RabbitMQ credentials defaulted to guest/guest and supplied values in the configuration were not used. As a result, all deployed overclouds used the same credentials (guest/guest). A remote non-authenticated attacker could use this flaw to access RabbitMQ services in the deployed cloud."
