  "details": [
    "The fragment_add_work function in epan/reassemble.c in the packet-reassembly feature in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not properly determine the defragmentation state in a case of an insufficient snapshot length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted packet.",
    "A flaw was found in the way packet reassembly code of wireshark would parse a packet which could leak memory. An attacker could use this flaw to crash wireshark by sending a specially crafted packet onto the wire or by convincing wireshark user to read malformed packet trace file."
