  "details": [
    "The ne2000_receive function in hw/net/ne2000.c in QEMU before 2.4.0.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and instance crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to receiving packets.",
    "A flaw was found where a QEMU emulator built with NE2000 NIC emulation support was vulnerable to an infinite loop issue that occurred when receiving packets over the network. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in a denial of service."
