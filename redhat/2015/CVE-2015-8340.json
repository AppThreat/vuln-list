  "mitigation": "The vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege. In Xen HVM, controlling the guest's kernel would involve locking down the bootloader.",

  "details": [
    "The memory_exchange function in common/memory.c in Xen 3.2.x through 4.6.x does not properly release locks, which might allow guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (deadlock or host crash) via unspecified vectors, related to XENMEM_exchange error handling.",
