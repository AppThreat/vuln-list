  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The fs_pin implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.0.5 does not ensure the internal consistency of a certain list data structure, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging user-namespace root access for an MNT_DETACH umount2 system call, related to fs/fs_pin.c and include/linux/fs_pin.h.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel which is related to the user namespace lazily unmounting file systems.  The fs_pin struct has two members (m_list and s_list) which are usually initialized on use in the pin_insert_group function.  However, these members might go unmodified; in this case, the system panics when it attempts to destroy or free them. This flaw could be used to launch a denial-of-service attack."
