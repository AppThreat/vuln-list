  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The ParseValue function in lexer.c in tidy before 4.9.31 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors involving multiple whitespace characters before an empty href, which triggers a large memory allocation.",
    "It was discovered that tidy did not properly process certain character sequences. By tricking an application that is using tidy into processing a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application."
