  "details": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow in SPICE before 0.12.6 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (heap-based memory corruption and QEMU-KVM crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host via QXL commands related to the surface_id parameter.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way spice handled certain QXL commands related to the \"surface_id\" parameter. A user in a guest could use this flaw to crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process."
