  "details": [
    "The NetKVM Windows Virtio driver allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (guest crash) via a crafted length value in an IP packet, as demonstrated by a value that does not account for the size of the IP options.",
    "It was found that the Windows Virtio NIC driver did not sufficiently sanitize the length of the incoming IP packets, as demonstrated by a packet with IP options present but the overall packet length not being adjusted to reflect the length of those options. A remote attacker able to send a specially crafted IP packet to the guest could use this flaw to crash that guest."
