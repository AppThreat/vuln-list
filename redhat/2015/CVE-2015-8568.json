    "Memory leak in QEMU, when built with a VMWARE VMXNET3 paravirtual NIC emulator support, allows local guest users to cause a denial of service (host memory consumption) by trying to activate the vmxnet3 device repeatedly.",
    "A memory-leak flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with VMWARE VMXNET3 paravirtual NIC emulator support. The flaw occurred when a guest repeatedly tried to activate the VMXNET3 device. A privileged guest attacker could use this flaw to leak host memory, resulting in denial of service on the host."
