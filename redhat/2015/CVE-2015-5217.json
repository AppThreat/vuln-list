    "providers/saml2/admin.py in the Identity Provider (IdP) server in Ipsilon 0.1.0 before 1.0.1 does not properly check permissions to update the SAML2 Service Provider (SP) owner, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service via a duplicate SP name.",
    "A flaw was discovered that the Ipsilon IdP server did not properly authorize a change of the provider's name. Non-administrative users could use this flaw to change the name to a duplicate value, which could possibly lead to denial-of-service attack."
