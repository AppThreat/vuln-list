  "details": [
    "scripts/xzgrep.in in xzgrep 5.2.x before 5.2.0, before 5.0.0 does not properly process file names containing semicolons, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by having a user run xzgrep on a crafted file name.",
    "It was discovered that the xzgrep's xz helper script did not properly sanitize certain file names. A local attacker could use this flaw to inject and execute arbitrary commands by tricking a user into running the xzgrep script on a file with a specially crafted file name."
