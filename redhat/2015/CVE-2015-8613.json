    "Stack-based buffer overflow in the megasas_ctrl_get_info function in QEMU, when built with SCSI MegaRAID SAS HBA emulation support, allows local guest users to cause a denial of service (QEMU instance crash) via a crafted SCSI controller CTRL_GET_INFO command.",

The flaw occurs when processing the SCSI controller's CTRL_GET_INFO command. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance (denial of service)."
