    "contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware in Django 1.8.x before 1.8.4, 1.7.x before 1.7.10, 1.4.x before 1.4.22, and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session store consumption or session record removal) via a large number of requests to contrib.auth.views.logout, which triggers the creation of an empty session record.",
    "It was found that Django incorrectly handled the session store. A session could be created by anonymously accessing the django.contrib.auth.views.logout view if it was not decorated correctly with django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required. A remote attacker could use this flaw to fill up the session store or cause other users' session records to be evicted by requesting a large number of new sessions."
