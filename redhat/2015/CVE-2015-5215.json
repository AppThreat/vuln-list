  "details": [
    "The default configuration of the Jinja templating engine used in the Identity Provider (IdP) server in Ipsilon 0.1.0 before 1.0.1 does not enable auto-escaping, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via template variables. NOTE: This may be a duplicate of CVE-2015-5216. Moreover, the Jinja development team does not enable auto-escape by default for performance issues as explained in https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/master/faq/#why-is-autoescaping-not-the-default.",
    "It was found that the Ipsilon IdP server used the default configuration of the Jinja templating engine, which did not HTML escape template variables. This could be exploited to perform an XSS attack if a value from untrusted input was used in the template and rendered in the user`s browser."
