    "providers/saml2/admin.py in the Identity Provider (IdP) server in Ipsilon 0.1.0 before 1.0.2 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1 does not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service by deleting a SAML2 Service Provider (SP).",
    "It was found that Ipsilon did not check whether a user is authorized to delete a service provider. An authenticated user could use this flaw to delete any service provider, potentially resulting in a denial of service."
