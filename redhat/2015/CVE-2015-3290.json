  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform improperly relies on espfix64 during nested NMI processing, which allows local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI within a certain instruction window.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's nested NMI handler and espfix64 functionalities interacted during NMI processing. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system."
