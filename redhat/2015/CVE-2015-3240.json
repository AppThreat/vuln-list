  "details": [
    "The pluto IKE daemon in libreswan before 3.15 and Openswan before 2.6.45, when built with NSS, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon restart) via a zero DH g^x value in a KE payload in a IKE packet.",
    "A flaw was discovered in the way Libreswan's IKE daemon processed IKE KE payloads. A remote attacker could send specially crafted IKE payload with a KE payload of g^x=0 that, when processed, would lead to a denial of service (daemon crash)."
