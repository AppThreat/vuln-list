  "details": [
    "The Red Hat docker package before 1.5.0-28, when using the --add-registry option, falls back to HTTP when the HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2014-5277 regression.",
    "It was found that the fix for the CVE-2014-5277 issue was incomplete: the docker client could under certain circumstances erroneously fall back to HTTP when an HTTPS connection to a registry failed. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain authentication and image data from traffic sent from a client to the registry."
