    "This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority for the following reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2015-5257. Reason: This candidate is a reservation duplicate of CVE-2015-5257. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2015-5257 instead of this candidate.

    "A denial of service vulnerability was found in the WhiteHEAT USB Serial Driver (whiteheat_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c). In the driver, the COMMAND_PORT variable was hard coded and set to 4 (5th element). The driver assumed that the number of ports would always be 5 and used port number 5 as the command port. However, when using a USB device in which the number of ports was set to a number less than 5 (for example, 3), the driver triggered a kernel NULL-pointer dereference. A non-privileged attacker could use this flaw to panic the host."
