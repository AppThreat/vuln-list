  "details": [
    "The getresponse function in ntpq in NTP versions before 4.2.8p9 and 4.3.x before 4.3.90 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via crafted packets with incorrect values.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the ntpq client processed certain incoming packets in a loop in the getresponse() function. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an ntpq client instance."
