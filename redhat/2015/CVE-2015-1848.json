  "details": [
    "The pcs daemon (pcsd) in PCS 0.9.137 and earlier does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types. CVE-2015-3983 is for the issue with not setting the HTTPOnly flag.",
    "It was found that the pcs daemon did not sign cookies containing session data that were sent to clients connecting via the pcsd web UI. A remote attacker could use this flaw to forge cookies and bypass authorization checks, possibly gaining elevated privileges in the pcsd web UI."
