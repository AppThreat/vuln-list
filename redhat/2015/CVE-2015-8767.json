  "name": "CVE-2015-8767",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3 does not properly manage the relationship between a lock and a socket, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via a crafted sctp_accept call.",
    "A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation handled sctp_accept() during the processing of heartbeat timeout events. A remote attacker could use this flaw to prevent further connections to be accepted by the SCTP server running on the system, resulting in a denial of service."
