  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "NTP before 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.x before 4.3.90 allows remote attackers to bypass the origin timestamp validation via a packet with an origin timestamp set to zero.",
    "It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check the originate timestamp in received packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted packet to an ntpd client that would effectively disable synchronization with the server, or push arbitrary offset/delay measurements to modify the time on the client."
