  "details": [
    "The Portlet Bridge for JavaServer Faces in Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.2.0, when used in portlets with the default resource serving for GenericPortlet, does not properly restrict access to restricted resources, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a URL with a modified resource ID.",
    "It was found that JavaServer Faces PortletBridge-based portlets using GenericPortlet's default resource serving did not restrict access to resources within the web application. An attacker could set the resource ID field of a URL to potentially bypass security constraints and gain access to restricted resources."
