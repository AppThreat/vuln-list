  "name": "CVE-2015-8374",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "fs/btrfs/inode.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.3 mishandles compressed inline extents, which allows local users to obtain sensitive pre-truncation information from a file via a clone action.",
    "An information-leak vulnerability was found in the kernel when it truncated a file to a smaller size which consisted of an inline extent that was compressed. The data between the new file size and the old file size was not discarded and the number of bytes used by the inode were not correctly decremented, which gave the wrong report for callers of the stat(2) syscall. This wasted metadata space and allowed for the truncated data to be leaked, and data corruption or loss to occur.  A caller of the clone ioctl could exploit this flaw by using only standard file-system operations without root access to read the truncated data."
