  "details": [
    "Buffer overflow in the vnc_refresh_server_surface function in the VNC display driver in QEMU before 2.4.0.1 allows guest users to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and process crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host via unspecified vectors, related to refreshing the server display surface.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow issue was found in the QEMU emulator's VNC display driver. It could occur while refreshing the VNC server's display surface using the vnc_refresh_server_surface() routine. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt the heap memory and crash the QEMU process instance, or to potentially use it to execute arbitrary code on the host."
