  "details": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow in wpa_supplicant 1.0 through 2.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), read memory, or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted SSID information in a management frame when creating or updating P2P entries.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way wpa_supplicant handled SSID information in the Wi-Fi Direct / P2P management frames. A specially crafted frame could allow an attacker within Wi-Fi radio range to cause wpa_supplicant to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code."
