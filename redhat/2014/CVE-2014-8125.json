  "details": [
    "XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in Drools and jBPM before 6.2.0 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or possibly have other unspecified impact via a crafted BPMN2 file.",
    "It was discovered that the jBPM runtime performed expansion of external parameter entities while executing BPMN2 files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks."
