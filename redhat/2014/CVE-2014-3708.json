  "details": [
    "OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.4 and 2014.2.x before 2014.2.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an IP filter in a list active servers API request.",
    "A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute (nova) looked up VM instances based on an IP address filter. An attacker with sufficient privileges on an OpenStack installation with a large amount of VMs could use this flaw to cause the main nova process to block for an extended amount of time."
