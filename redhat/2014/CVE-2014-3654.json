  "details": [
    "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in spacewalk-java 2.0.2 in Spacewalk and Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite 5.5 and 5.6 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors to (1) kickstart/cobbler/CustomSnippetList.do, (2) channels/software/Entitlements.do, or (3) admin/multiorg/OrgUsers.do.",
    "Stored and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way spacewalk-java displayed certain information. By sending a specially crafted request to Satellite, a remote, authenticated attacker could embed HTML content into the stored data, allowing them to inject malicious content into the web page that is used to view that data."
