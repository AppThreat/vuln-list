  "details": [
    "sound/core/control.c in the ALSA control implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not ensure possession of a read/write lock, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging /dev/snd/controlCX access.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled user controls. A local, privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system."
