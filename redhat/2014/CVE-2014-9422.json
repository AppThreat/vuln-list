    "The check_rpcsec_auth function in kadmin/server/kadm_rpc_svc.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 allows remote authenticated users to bypass a kadmin/* authorization check and obtain administrative access by leveraging access to a two-component principal with an initial \"kadmind\" substring, as demonstrated by a \"ka/x\" principal.",
    "It was found that the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind) incorrectly accepted certain authentication requests for two-component server principal names. A remote attacker able to acquire a key with a particularly named principal (such as \"kad/x\") could use this flaw to impersonate any user to kadmind, and perform administrative actions as that user."
