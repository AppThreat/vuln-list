  "details": [
    "The krb5_gss_process_context_token function in lib/gssapi/krb5/process_context_token.c in the libgssapi_krb5 library in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 does not properly maintain security-context handles, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and double free, and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted GSSAPI traffic, as demonstrated by traffic to kadmind.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos libgssapi_krb5 library processed valid context deletion tokens. An attacker able to make an application using the GSS-API library (libgssapi) call the gss_process_context_token() function could use this flaw to crash that application."
