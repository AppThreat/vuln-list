  "details": [
    "OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted DTLS message that is processed with a different read operation for the handshake header than for the handshake body, related to the dtls1_get_record function in d1_pkt.c and the ssl3_read_n function in s3_pkt.c.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the DTLS implementation of OpenSSL. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted DTLS message, which would cause an OpenSSL server to crash."
