  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a free operation on a stack-based character array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because the standard erealloc behavior makes the free operation unreachable"
