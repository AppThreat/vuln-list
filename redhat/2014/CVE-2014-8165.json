  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "scripts/amsvis/powerpcAMS/amsnet.py in powerpc-utils-python uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object.",
    "It was found that the amsvis command of the powerpc-utils-python package did not verify unpickled data before processing it. This could allow an attacker who can connect to an amsvis server process (or cause an amsvis client process to connect to them) to execute arbitrary code as the user running the amsvis process."
