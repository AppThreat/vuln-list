  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.12 does not have an exit handler for the INVEPT instruction, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application.",
    "It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) instructions. On hosts with an Intel processor and invept VM exit support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest."
