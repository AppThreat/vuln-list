  "details": [
    "Integer overflow in TigerVNC allows remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to screen size handling, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, a similar issue to CVE-2014-6051.",
    "An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way TigerVNC handled screen sizes. A malicious VNC server could use this flaw to cause a client to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the client."
