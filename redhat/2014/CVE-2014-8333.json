    "A flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) VMWare driver, which could allow an authenticated user to delete an instance while it was in the resize state, causing the instance to remain on the back end. A malicious user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by exhausting all available resources on the system."
