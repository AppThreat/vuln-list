  "details": [
    "Race condition in the VMware driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.4 and 2014.2 before 2014.2rc1 allows remote authenticated users to access unintended consoles by spawning an instance that triggers the same VNC port to be allocated to two different instances.",
    "A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected."
