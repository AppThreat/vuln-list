  "details": [
    "The ieee80211_fragment function in net/mac80211/tx.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.5 does not properly maintain a certain tail pointer, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information by reading packets.",
    "An information leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IEEE 802.11 wireless networking implementation. When software encryption was used, a remote attacker could use this flaw to leak up to 8 bytes of plaintext."
