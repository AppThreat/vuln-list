  "details": [
    "HornetQ REST is vulnerable to XML External Entity due to insecure configuration of RestEasy",
    "It was discovered that HornetQ REST did not set the resteasy.document.expand.entity.references context parameter to false by default. A HornetQ REST application, which does not explicitly set the required context parameter to false, may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a HornetQ REST endpoint could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks."
