  "details": [
    "wpa_supplicant and hostapd 0.7.2 through 2.2, when running with certain configurations and using wpa_cli or hostapd_cli with action scripts, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted frame.",
    "A command injection flaw was found in the way the wpa_cli utility executed action scripts. If wpa_cli was run in daemon mode to execute an action script (specified using the -a command line option), and wpa_supplicant was configured to connect to a P2P group, malicious P2P group parameters could cause wpa_cli to execute arbitrary code."
