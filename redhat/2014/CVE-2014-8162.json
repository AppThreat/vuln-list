  "details": [
    "XML external entity (XXE) in the RPC interface in Spacewalk and Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite 5.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files and possibly have other unspecified impact via unknown vectors.",
    "It was found that the RPC interface in Satellite would resolve external entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the Satellite server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks."
