  "details": [
    "The is_utf8_well_formed function in GNU less before 475 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via malformed UTF-8 characters, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.",
    "An out of bound read, with a maximum of 5 bytes, was found in the way the is_utf8_well_formed() function parsed UTF-8 characters. If less was to be recompiled with an address sanitizer, a specially crafted input could crash less."
