  "name": "CVE-2014-3565",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "snmplib/mib.c in net-snmp 5.7.0 and earlier, when the -OQ option is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (snmptrapd crash) via a crafted SNMP trap message, which triggers a conversion to the variable type designated in the MIB file, as demonstrated by a NULL type in an ifMtu trap message.",
    "A denial of service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled certain SNMP traps when started with the \"-OQ\" option. If an attacker sent an SNMP trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an integer variable type was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash."
