  "details": [
    "unzip 6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write and crash) via an extra field with an uncompressed size smaller than the compressed field size in a zip archive that advertises STORED method compression.",
    "A buffer overflow was found in the way unzip uncompressed certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive could cause unzip to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when the archive was tested with unzip's '-t' option."
