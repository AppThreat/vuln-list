  "details": [
    "The _gnutls_ecc_ansi_x963_export function in gnutls_ecc.c in GnuTLS 3.x before 3.1.28, 3.2.x before 3.2.20, and 3.3.x before 3.3.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted (1) Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificate or (2) certificate signing requests (CSR), related to generating key IDs.",
    "An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed certain ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) certificates or certificate signing requests (CSR). A malicious user could create a specially crafted ECC certificate or a certificate signing request that, when processed by an application compiled against GnuTLS (for example, certtool), could cause that application to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application."
