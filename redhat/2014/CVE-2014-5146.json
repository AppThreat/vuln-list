    "Certain MMU virtualization operations in Xen 4.2.x through 4.4.x before the xsa97-hap patch, when using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP), are not preemptible, which allows local HVM guest to cause a denial of service (vcpu consumption) by invoking these operations, which process every page assigned to a guest, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-5149."
