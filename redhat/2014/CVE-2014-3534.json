  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "arch/s390/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.8 on the s390 platform does not properly restrict address-space control operations in PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA requests, which allows local users to obtain read and write access to kernel memory locations, and consequently gain privileges, via a crafted application that makes a ptrace system call.",
    "It was found that Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem did not properly sanitize the address-space-control bits when the program-status word (PSW) was being set. On IBM S/390 systems, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to set address-space-control bits to the kernel space, and thus gain read and write access to kernel memory."
