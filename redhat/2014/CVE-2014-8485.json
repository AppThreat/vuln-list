  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The setup_group function in bfd/elf.c in libbfd in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted section group headers in an ELF file.",
    "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way various binutils utilities processed certain files. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, it could cause the utility used to process that file to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that utility."
