  "details": [
    "Node.js 0.8 before 0.8.28 and 0.10 before 0.10.30 does not consider the possibility of recursive processing that triggers V8 garbage collection in conjunction with a V8 interrupt, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via deep JSON objects whose parsing lets this interrupt mask an overflow of the program stack.",
    "It was discovered that V8 did not properly check the stack size limit in certain cases. A remote attacker able to send a request that caused a script executed by V8 to use deep recursion could trigger a stack overflow, leading to a crash of an application using V8."
