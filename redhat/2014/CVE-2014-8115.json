  "name": "CVE-2014-8115",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The default authorization constrains in KIE Workbench 6.0.x allows remote authenticated users to read or write to arbitrary files, bypass intended access restrictions, and possibly have other unspecified impact via unknown vectors.",
    "It was discovered that the default authorization constrains applied on servelets deployed in the KIE Workbench application were insufficient. A remote, authenticated user without sufficient privileges could use this flaw to upload or download arbitrary files, perform privileged actions that otherwise cannot be accessed, or perform other more complex attacks."
