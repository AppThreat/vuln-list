  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The sosendto function in slirp/udp.c in QEMU before 2.1.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by sending a udp packet with a value of 0 in the source port and address, which triggers access of an uninitialized socket.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way QEMU handled UDP packets with a source port and address of 0 when QEMU's user networking was in use. A local guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest."
