  "details": [
    "The V3 API in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2014.1.x before 2014.1.2.1 and Juno before Juno-3 updates the issued_at value for UUID v2 tokens, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass the token expiration and retain access via a verification (1) GET or (2) HEAD request to v3/auth/tokens/.",
    "A flaw was found in keystone revocation events that resulted in the \"issued_at\" time being updated when a token created by the V2 API was processed by the V3 API. This could allow a user to evade token revocation. Only OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of revocation events and UUID tokens were affected."
