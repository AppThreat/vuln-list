  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "When using the CAS Proxy ticket authentication from Spring Security 3.1 to 3.2.4 a malicious CAS Service could trick another CAS Service into authenticating a proxy ticket that was not associated. This is due to the fact that the proxy ticket authentication uses the information from the HttpServletRequest which is populated based upon untrusted information within the HTTP request. This means if there are access control restrictions on which CAS services can authenticate to one another, those restrictions can be bypassed. If users are not using CAS Proxy tickets and not basing access control decisions based upon the CAS Service, then there is no impact to users.",
    "When using Spring Security's CAS Proxy ticket authentication, a malicious CAS Service could trick another CAS Service into authenticating a proxy ticket that was not associated. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass any access control restrictions on which CAS services can authenticate to one another."
