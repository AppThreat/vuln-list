  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The __switch_to function in arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 does not ensure that Thread Local Storage (TLS) descriptors are loaded before proceeding with other steps, which makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application that reads a TLS base address.",
    "An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel changed certain segment registers and thread-local storage (TLS) during a context switch. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak the user space TLS base address of an arbitrary process."
