    "Teiid before 8.4.3 and before 8.7 and Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 before patch 3 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a crafted request to a REST endpoint, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.",
    "It was found that Teiid SQL/XML permitted XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. If a REST endpoint was deployed, a remote attacker could submit a request containing an external XML entity that, when resolved, allowed that attacker to read files on the application server in the context of the user running that server."
