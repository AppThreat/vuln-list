A future update may address this issue.\n* Red Hat does not support or recommend running untrusted images.\n* In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw's impact is low and docker is not directly used by the director-operator, no update will be provided at this time for the operator containers.",

  "details": [
    "Path traversal vulnerability in Docker before 1.3.3 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files and bypass a container protection mechanism via a full pathname in a symlink in an (1) image or (2) build in a Dockerfile.",
    "It was found that a malicious container image could overwrite arbitrary portions of the host file system by including absolute symlinks, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
