Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 may address this issue.\nGiven the Moderate impact and the fact that BRTFS file system is no longer Technology preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.19 does not ensure that the visible xattr state is consistent with a requested replacement, which allows local users to bypass intended ACL settings and gain privileges via standard filesystem operations (1) during an xattr-replacement time window, related to a race condition, or (2) after an xattr-replacement attempt that fails because the data does not fit."
