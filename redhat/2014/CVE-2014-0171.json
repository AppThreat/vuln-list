  "details": [
    "XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in StaxXMLFactoryProvider2 in Odata4j, as used in Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization before 6.0.0 patch 4, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a crafted request to a REST endpoint.",
    "It was found that Odata4j permitted XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. If a REST endpoint was deployed, a remote attacker could submit a request containing an external XML entity that, when resolved, allowed that attacker to read files on the application server in the context of the user running that server."
