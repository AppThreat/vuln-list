  "statement": "Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of samba as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7, and Red Hat Storage 2.1 and 3.0, versions of samba3x as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, versions of samba4 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, as they did not include support for Samba Active Directory Domain Controller. All shipped Samba versions are using MIT Kerberos implementation as its Kerberos infrastructure of choice. The Samba builds shipped are using MIT Kerberos implementation in order to allow system-wide interoperability between both desktop and server applications running on the same machine.",
