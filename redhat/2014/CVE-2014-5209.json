  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 in their default configurations. Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses the `restrict noquery` option by default, which denies ntpdc queries. No proper fix is available for this issue upstream, apart from disabling these kind of queries by default or denying them through the `restrict` access control command specified in /etc/ntp.conf. Users are adviced to use `noquery` in their configurations and allow them only from a trusted set of network addresses.",

  "details": [
    "An Information Disclosure vulnerability exists in NTP 4.2.7p25 private (mode 6/7) messages via a GET_RESTRICT control message, which could let a malicious user obtain sensitive information.",
    "A flaw was discovered where an information disclosure is present in the Network Time Protocol (NTP) through the GET_RESTRICT control message, which can be sent with the reslist command of the ntpdc tool. An attacker can use this message to obtain sensitive information such as internal IP addresses and NTPâ€™s configuration settings."
