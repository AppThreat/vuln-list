  "details": [
    "GNOME Shell 3.14.x before 3.14.1, when the Screen Lock feature is used, does not limit the aggregate memory consumption of all active PrtSc requests, which allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary commands on an unattended workstation by making many PrtSc requests and leveraging a temporary lock outage, and the resulting temporary shell availability, caused by the Linux kernel OOM killer.",
    "It was found that the Gnome shell did not disable the Print Screen key when the screen was locked. This could allow an attacker with physical access to a system with a locked screen to crash the screen-locking application by creating a large amount of screenshots."
