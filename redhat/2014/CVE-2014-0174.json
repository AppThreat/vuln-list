  "details": [
    "Cumin (aka MRG Management Console), as used in Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5, does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for the session cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie.",
    "It was found that Cumin did not set the HttpOnly flag on session cookies. This could allow a malicious script to access the session cookie."
