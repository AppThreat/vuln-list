    "OpenStack Identity (Keystone) before 2013.2.4, 2014.x before 2014.1.2, and Juno before Juno-2 allows remote authenticated trustees to gain access to an unauthorized project for which the trustor has certain roles via the project ID in a V2 API trust token request.",
    "A flaw was found in the way keystone handled trusts. A trustee could use an out-of-scope project ID to gain unauthorized access to a project if the trustor had the required roles for that requested project."
