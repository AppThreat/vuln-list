  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "include/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_extend.h in the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.14.5 uses an insufficiently large data type for certain extension data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via outbound network traffic that triggers extension loading, as demonstrated by configuring a PPTP tunnel in a NAT environment.",
    "An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's netfilter connection tracking implementation loaded extensions. An attacker on a local network could potentially send a sequence of specially crafted packets that would initiate the loading of a large number of extensions, causing the targeted system in that network to crash."
