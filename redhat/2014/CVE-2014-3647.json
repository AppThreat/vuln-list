Future kernel updates may address this issue.\nThis issue does affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. The risks associated with fixing this bug are greater than its security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\nThis issue does affect the kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle.

  "name": "CVE-2014-3647",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not properly perform RIP changes, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem handled non-canonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the RIP (for example, branches or calls). A guest user with access to an I/O or MMIO region could use this flaw to crash the guest."
