  "name": "CVE-2014-4171",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does not properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i_mutex hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an MADV_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE fallocate call.",
    "A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mmap(2), madvise(2), and fallocate(2) system calls interacted with each other while operating on virtual memory file system files. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service."
