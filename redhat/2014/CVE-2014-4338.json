  "details": [
    "cups-browsed in cups-filters before 1.0.53 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging a malformed cups-browsed.conf BrowseAllow directive that is interpreted as granting browse access to all IP addresses.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the cups-browsed daemon interpreted the \"BrowseAllow\" directive in the cups-browsed.conf file. An attacker able to add a malformed \"BrowseAllow\" directive to the cups-browsed.conf file could use this flaw to bypass intended access restrictions."
