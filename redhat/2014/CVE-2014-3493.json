    "The push_ascii function in smbd in Samba 3.6.x before 3.6.24, 4.0.x before 4.0.19, and 4.1.x before 4.1.9 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and daemon crash) via an attempt to read a Unicode pathname without specifying use of Unicode, leading to a character-set conversion failure that triggers an invalid pointer dereference.",
    "It was discovered that smbd, the Samba file server daemon, did not properly handle certain files that were stored on the disk and used a valid Unicode character in the file name. An attacker able to send an authenticated non-Unicode request that attempted to read such a file could cause smbd to crash."
