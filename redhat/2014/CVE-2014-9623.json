  "details": [
    "OpenStack Glance 2014.2.x through 2014.2.1, 2014.1.3, and earlier allows remote authenticated users to bypass the storage quota and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by deleting an image in the saving state.",
    "A storage quota bypass flaw was found in OpenStack Image (glance). If an image was deleted while it was being uploaded, it would not count towards a user's quota. A malicious user could use this flaw to deliberately fill the backing store, and cause a denial of service."
