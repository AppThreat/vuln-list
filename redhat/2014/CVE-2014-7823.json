  "name": "CVE-2014-7823",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The virDomainGetXMLDesc API in Libvirt before 1.2.11 allows remote read-only users to obtain the VNC password by using the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_MIGRATABLE flag, which triggers the use of the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE flag.",
    "It was found that when the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_MIGRATABLE flag was used, the QEMU driver implementation of the virDomainGetXMLDesc() function could bypass the restrictions of the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE flag. A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to leak certain limited information from the domain XML data."
