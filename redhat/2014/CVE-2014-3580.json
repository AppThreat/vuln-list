  "details": [
    "The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Apache Subversion 1.x before 1.7.19 and 1.8.x before 1.8.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and server crash) via a REPORT request for a resource that does not exist.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_dav_svn module handled REPORT requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use a specially crafted REPORT request to crash mod_dav_svn."
