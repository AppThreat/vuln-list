    "Docker 1.3.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges via a crafted (1) image or (2) build in a Dockerfile in an LZMA (.xz) archive, related to the chroot for archive extraction.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the Docker service unpacked images or builds after a \"docker pull\". An attacker could use this flaw to provide a malicious image or build that, when unpacked, would escalate their privileges on the system."
