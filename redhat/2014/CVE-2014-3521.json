    "The component in (1) /luci/homebase and (2) /luci/cluster menu in Red Hat Conga 0.12.2 allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted URL.",
    "It was discovered that various components in the luci site extension-related URLs were not properly restricted to administrative users. A remote, authenticated attacker could escalate their privileges to perform certain actions that should be restricted to administrative users, such as adding users and systems, and viewing log data."
