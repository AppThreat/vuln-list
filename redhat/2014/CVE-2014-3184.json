  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The report_fixup functions in the HID subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.16.2 might allow physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted device that provides a small report descriptor, related to (1) drivers/hid/hid-cherry.c, (2) drivers/hid/hid-kye.c, (3) drivers/hid/hid-lg.c, (4) drivers/hid/hid-monterey.c, (5) drivers/hid/hid-petalynx.c, and (6) drivers/hid/hid-sunplus.c.",
    "Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the Cherry Cymotion keyboard driver, KYE/Genius device drivers, Logitech device drivers, Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard driver, Petalynx Maxter remote control driver, and Sunplus wireless desktop driver handled HID reports with an invalid report descriptor size. An attacker with physical access to the system could use either of these flaws to write data past an allocated memory buffer."
