  "details": [
    "The BN_sqr implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k does not properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value, which might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors, related to crypto/bn/asm/mips.pl, crypto/bn/asm/x86_64-gcc.c, and crypto/bn/bn_asm.c.",
    "It was found that OpenSSL's BigNumber Squaring implementation could produce incorrect results under certain special conditions. This flaw could possibly affect certain OpenSSL library functionality, such as RSA blinding. Note that this issue occurred rarely and with a low probability, and there is currently no known way of exploiting it."
