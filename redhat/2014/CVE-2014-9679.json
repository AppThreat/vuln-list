  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Integer underflow in the cupsRasterReadPixels function in filter/raster.c in CUPS before 2.0.2 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a malformed compressed raster file, which triggers a buffer overflow.",
    "An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way CUPS handled compressed raster image files. An attacker could create a specially crafted image file that, when passed via the CUPS Raster filter, could cause the CUPS filter to crash."
