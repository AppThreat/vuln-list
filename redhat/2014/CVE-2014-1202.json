  "statement": "Not affected. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4.3 and 5.3 support the SOAPClient action, which will use the SoapUI library to make calls to external web services. However, these products use SoapUI 1.7.1, while the vulnerable property expansion feature was not introduced until SoapUI 2.5. Therefore no Red Hat products are affected by this flaw.",
