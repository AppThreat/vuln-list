  "statement": "This issue does affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 6 and 7. Future updates may address this issue in the\nrespective Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases.\nThis issue does affect the kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, even though the impact is limited.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.17.2 on Intel processors does not ensure that the value in the CR4 control register remains the same after a VM entry, which allows host OS users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a denial of service (system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access, as demonstrated by PR_SET_TSC prctl calls within a modified copy of QEMU.",
    "It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM implementation did not ensure that the host CR4 control register value remained unchanged across VM entries on the same virtual CPU. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service on the system."
