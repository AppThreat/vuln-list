  "details": [
    "lib/handle.c in Hivex before 1.3.11 allows local users to execute arbitrary code and gain privileges via a small hive files, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write.",
    "It was found that hivex attempted to read, and possibly write, beyond its allocated buffer when reading a hive file with a very small size or with a truncated or improperly formatted content. An attacker able to supply a specially crafted hive file to an application using the hivex library could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that application."
