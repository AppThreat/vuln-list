  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not properly handle private syscall numbers during use of the perf subsystem, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and OOPS) or bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application.",
    "An out-of-bounds memory access flaw, CVE-2014-7825, was found in the syscall tracing functionality of the Linux kernel's perf subsystem. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system. Additionally, an out-of-bounds memory access flaw, CVE-2014-7826, was found in the syscall tracing functionality of the Linux kernel's ftrace subsystem. On a system with ftrace syscall tracing enabled, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system, or escalate their privileges."
