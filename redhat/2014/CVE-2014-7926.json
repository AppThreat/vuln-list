  "statement": "The flaw is caused because the ICU regular expression compiler is unable to properly handle certain malformed patterns. Because of the way in which this flaw manifests itself, it can only be triggered via untrusted content, which is common for components such as web browsers, in this case, the Chromium browser. \nThis flaw has been rated moderate for ICU component in Red Hat products, because either it is very difficult to trigger this flaw, or it is unusual to directly pass untrusted parameters to the ICU library.",

  "details": [
    "The Regular Expressions package in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 52 before SVN revision 292944, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to a zero-length quantifier."
