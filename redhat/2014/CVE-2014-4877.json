  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Absolute path traversal vulnerability in GNU Wget before 1.16, when recursion is enabled, allows remote FTP servers to write to arbitrary files, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via a LIST response that references the same filename within two entries, one of which indicates that the filename is for a symlink.",
    "A flaw was found in the way Wget handled symbolic links. A malicious FTP server could allow Wget running in the mirror mode (using the '-m' command line option) to write an arbitrary file to a location writable to by the user running Wget, possibly leading to code execution."
