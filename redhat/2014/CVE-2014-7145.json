  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The SMB2_tcon function in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16.3 allows remote CIFS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and client system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by deleting the IPC$ share during resolution of DFS referrals.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Common Internet File System (CIFS) implementation handled mounting of file system shares. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a client system that would mount a file system share from a malicious server."
