  "statement": "This issue affects the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\nTo mitigate this issue, you may use the ip6tables command to prevent spoofing of local addresses on any network interface other than the loopback interface.  Refer to the Mitigation section on our KBase article: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1305723",

  "name": "CVE-2014-9751",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The read_network_packet function in ntp_io.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p1 on Linux and OS X does not properly determine whether a source IP address is an IPv6 loopback address, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof restricted packets, and read or write to the runtime state, by leveraging the ability to reach the ntpd machine's network interface with a packet from the ::1 address.",
    "It was found that because NTP's access control was based on a source IP address, an attacker could bypass source IP restrictions and send malicious control and configuration packets by spoofing ::1 addresses."
