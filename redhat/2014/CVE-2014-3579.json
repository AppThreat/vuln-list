  "details": [
    "XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ Apollo 1.x before 1.7.1 allows remote consumers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving an XPath based selector when dequeuing XML messages.",
    "It was discovered that Apache ActiveMQ Apollo performed XML External Entity (XXE) expansion when evaluating XPath expressions. A remote, attacker-controlled consumer able to specify an XPath-based selector to dequeue XML messages from an Apache ActiveMQ Apollo broker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the broker, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks."
