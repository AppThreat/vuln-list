    "OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2014.1.x before 2014.1.2.1 and Juno before Juno-3 does not properly revoke tokens when a domain is invalidated, which allows remote authenticated users to retain access via a domain-scoped token for that domain.",
    "It was discovered that domain-scoped tokens were not revoked when a domain was disabled. Only OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of revocation events were affected."
