  "details": [
    "Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the magicmouse_raw_event function in drivers/hid/hid-magicmouse.c in the Magic Mouse HID driver in the Linux kernel through 3.16.3 allow physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted device that provides a large amount of (1) EHCI or (2) XHCI data associated with an event.",
    "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way the Apple Magic Mouse/Trackpad multi-touch driver handled Human Interface Device (HID) reports with an invalid size. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system."
