  "statement": "This issue affects the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\nTo mitigate this issue, you may use the ip6tables command to prevent spoofing of local addresses on any network interface other than the loopback interface.  Refer to the Mitigation section on our KBase article: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1305723",

All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage",
    "It was found that because NTP's access control was based on a source IP address, an attacker could bypass source IP restrictions and send malicious control and configuration packets by spoofing ::1 addresses."
