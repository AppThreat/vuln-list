  "details": [
    "In Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24, attackers able to supply crafted PostScript files could use incorrect access checking in temp file handling to disclose contents of files on the system otherwise not readable.",
    "It was discovered that the ghostscript did not properly restrict access to files open prior to enabling the -dSAFER mode. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and disclose the content of affected files via a specially crafted PostScript document."
