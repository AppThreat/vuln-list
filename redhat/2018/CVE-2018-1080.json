  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Dogtag PKI, through version 10.6.1, has a vulnerability in AAclAuthz.java that, under certain configurations, causes the application of ACL allow and deny rules to be reversed. If a server is configured to process allow rules before deny rules (authz.evaluateOrder=allow,deny), then allow rules will deny access and deny rules will grant access. This may result in an escalation of privileges or have other unintended consequences.",
