  "details": [
    "The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.",
    "It was found that when a Node.js script is run in inspector mode, Node.js did not properly validate the Host header, leaving the inspector vulnerable to a DNS rebind attack and bypass same-origin policy. If a developer had an inspector session running, and was visiting a malicious website, the site could carry on a DNS rebind attack, allowing the site to have full access to the debugged script."
