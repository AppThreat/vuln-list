    "In Wireshark 2.6.0, 2.4.0 to 2.4.6, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.14, the Q.931 dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-q931.c by avoiding a use-after-free after a malformed packet prevented certain cleanup.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the code responsible for processing packages from Q.931 protocol, in wireshark. An attacker can send specially crafted packages over the network which, when received, would cause an application to crash, or potentially, corrupt information."
