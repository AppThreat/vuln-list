  "details": [
    "The HNCP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.3 has a buffer over-read in print-hncp.c:print_prefix().",
    "A flaw was found in tcpdump where an uninitialized buffer is accessed in tcpdump while printing HNCP packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when printed, would trigger the flaw and crash the application. System availability is the highest threat from this vulnerability."
