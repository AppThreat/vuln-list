    "It was found that vdsm before version 4.20.37 invokes qemu-img on untrusted inputs without limiting resources. By uploading a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause the qemu-img process to consume unbounded amounts of memory of CPU time, causing a denial of service condition that could potentially impact other users of the host.",
