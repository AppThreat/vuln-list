  "details": [
    "okular version 18.08 and earlier contains a Directory Traversal vulnerability in function \"unpackDocumentArchive(...)\" in \"core/document.cpp\" that can result in Arbitrary file creation on the user workstation. This attack appear to be exploitable via he victim must open a specially crafted Okular archive. This issue appears to have been corrected in version 18.08.1",
    "A path traversal vulnerability has been discovered in Okular, in the way it creates temporary files when reading an Okular archive. Paths are read from content.xml and they are not properly sanitized before being used as template file names for the temporary files created when extracting the Okular archive, thus allowing a local attacker to write files outside the target temporary directory."
