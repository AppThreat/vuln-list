  "statement": "This issue did affect the versions of gimp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. However, as this is an issue in a unit test, it is not a problem if you are using the precompiled gimp package. This is only a problem if you recompile gimp using the src.rpm/SPEC file. Even then it's only a problem if you do not make use of isolating build tools like mock, but instead use rpmbuild directly.",

  "name": "CVE-2018-12713",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "GIMP through 2.10.2 makes g_get_tmp_dir calls to establish temporary filenames, which may result in a filename that already exists, as demonstrated by the gimp_write_and_read_file function in app/tests/test-xcf.c. This might be leveraged by attackers to overwrite files or read file content that was intended to be private."
