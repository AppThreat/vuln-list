  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel through 3.2, the rds_message_alloc_sgs() function does not validate a value that is used during DMA page allocation, leading to a heap-based out-of-bounds write (related to the rds_rdma_extra_size function in net/rds/rdma.c).",
    "In the Linux kernel through 4.14.13, the rds_message_alloc_sgs() function does not validate a value that is used during DMA page allocation, leading to a heap-based out-of-bounds write (related to the rds_rdma_extra_size() function in 'net/rds/rdma.c') and thus to a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."
