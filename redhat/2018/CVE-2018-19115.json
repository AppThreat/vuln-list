  "details": [
    "keepalived before 2.0.7 has a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes resulting in DoS or possibly unspecified other impact, because extract_status_code in lib/html.c has no validation of the status code and instead writes an unlimited amount of data to the heap.",
    "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in extract_status_code() function in lib/html.c that parses HTTP status code returned from web server allows malicious web server or man-in-the-middle attacker pretending to be a web server to cause either a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on keepalived load balancer."
