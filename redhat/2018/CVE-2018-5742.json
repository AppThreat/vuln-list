  "statement": "This flaw appears to be exploitable only when debug logging is enabled and set to at least a level of 10. As this configuration should be rare in production instances of bind, it is unlikely that most servers will be exploitable. The debug level of the bind server can be checked via the rndc status command, which will return the current trace level as \"debug level\". A value of 10 or above would most likely make this flaw exploitable.",

  "details": [
    "While backporting a feature for a newer branch of BIND9, RedHat introduced a path leading to an assertion failure in buffer.c:420. Affects RedHat versions bind-9.9.4-65.el7 -\u003e bind-9.9.4-72.el7. No ISC releases are affected. Other packages from other distributions who made the same error may also be affected."
