  "statement": "A previous statement by Red Hat related to this CVE, prior to August 2019, said that Apache Struts 2 is not included in any Red Hat products. This earlier statement was incorrect. While Struts 2 is not actively compiled, shipped, used, or enabled in any Red Hat provided final products, and does not cause any vulnerability in the product, struts2-core jars have been included in some products' source code packages. The inclusion was part of an import of the Google Guice repository, which includes struts2-core. Customers that build artefacts from our source code could be at risk. Red Hat will remove these artefacts from source code in future releases.\nThe products that included the Struts 2 artefacts in their source jars:\nFuse Service Works 6.0.0\nSingle Sign On 7.3.0+\nIf you have used the source package from one of these products to build artefacts on your system, you should do the following to remove potentially affected jars:\n1. Run 'find . -name struts2*.jar' under the source location\n2. Remove any files found\nThis will not affect the product, as the jar is included with the source of google-guice, but no functionality requiring struts2 is implemented.",

  "details": [
    "The Apache Struts REST Plugin is using XStream library which is vulnerable and allow perform a DoS attack when using a malicious request with specially crafted XML payload. Upgrade to the Apache Struts version 2.5.16 and switch to an optional Jackson XML handler as described here http://struts.apache.org/plugins/rest/#custom-contenttypehandlers. Another option is to implement a custom XML handler based on the Jackson XML handler from the Apache Struts 2.5.16."
