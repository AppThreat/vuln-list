    "OpenFlow version 1.0 onwards contains a Denial of Service and Improper authorization vulnerability in OpenFlow handshake: The DPID (DataPath IDentifier) in the features_reply message are inherently trusted by the controller. that can result in Denial of Service, Unauthorized Access, Network Instability. This attack appear to be exploitable via Network connectivity: the attacker must first establish a transport connection with the OpenFlow controller and then initiate the OpenFlow handshake."
