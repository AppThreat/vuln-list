    "A flaw was found in Jolokia versions from 1.2 to before 1.6.1. Affected versions are vulnerable to a system-wide CSRF. This holds true for properly configured instances with strict checking for origin and referrer headers. This could result in a Remote Code Execution attack.",
    "A flaw was found in Jolokia, versions 1.2 through 1.6.0, where Jolokia did not correctly handle checking for origin and referrer headers when strict checking was enabled. An attacker could use this vulnerability to conduct cross-site request forgery or further attacks."
