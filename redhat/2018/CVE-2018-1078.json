  "details": [
    "OpenDayLight version Carbon SR3 and earlier contain a vulnerability during node reconciliation that can result in traffic flows that should be expired or should expire shortly being re-installed and their timers reset resulting in traffic being allowed that should be expired.",
    "It was found that all flows, including active and inactive, in the config datastore are installed back in the switch upon reconnection, as part of the node reconciliation process in OpenDayLight. This may lead to denial of service via table overflow or possibly circumventing of the controller's control."
