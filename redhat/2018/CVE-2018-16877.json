  "statement": "This is essentially a design level security flaw which can be combined with other flaws to achieve local privilege escalation for clusters running pacemaker. The attacker needs to have access to the cluster node running pacemaker (AV:L). The attacker can use easily use the design flaw via the confused deputy problem to run the exploit (AC:L), also needs to have login access to the pacemaker node to run the exploit (PR:L). \nDue to the elevated privileges obtained, there is an impact to the system beyond the pacemaker node itself (S:C). Lastly due to the attacker's ability to run arbitrary code as root, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system is affected. (CIA:H)",
