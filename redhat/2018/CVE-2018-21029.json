  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "systemd 239 through 245 accepts any certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority for DNS Over TLS. Server Name Indication (SNI) is not sent, and there is no hostname validation with the GnuTLS backend. NOTE: This has been disputed by the developer as not a vulnerability since hostname validation does not have anything to do with this issue (i.e. there is no hostname to be sent)",
    "A flaw in systemd-resolved was found to incorrectly verify certificates of a DNS resolver used for DNS Over TLS when the DNSOverTLS option is set to `yes`. A remote attacker in the network path between the vulnerable system and the DNS resolver may use this flaw to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and eavesdrop or modify DNS queries and responses. The attacker can learn the sites visited by a victim user, or redirect the victim user to malicious sites."
