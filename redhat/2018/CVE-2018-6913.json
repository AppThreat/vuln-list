    "Heap-based buffer overflow in the pack function in Perl before 5.26.2 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large item count.",
    "It was found that the pack() function in the 32-bit version of the perl interpreter was vulnerable to heap buffer overflow via the packing template. An attacker, able to provide a specially crafted template, could use this flaw to crash the interpreter."
