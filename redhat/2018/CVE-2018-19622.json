  "details": [
    "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the MMSE dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mmse.c by preventing length overflows.",
    "A vulnerability in MMSE dissector allows Wireshark to loop infinitely when parsing a specially crafted pcap file. Remote attacker could cause a denial of service to Wireshark by injecting malicious packets into the network that are automatically processed."
