  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of rhs-hadoop as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3. For JBoss Fuse 6.3 and 7 standalone, while they ship vulnerable artifact via camel-hbase, camel-hdfs2 (fuse 6.3) and camel-hdfs2 (fuse 7), there's no invocation on the flawed code that could lead to an unzip operation. So fuse 6.3, 7 standalone are not affected. However FIS 2.0 and Fuse 7 on OpenShift ship vulnerable artifact via maven BOM, so setting fuse as affected for this reason.",
