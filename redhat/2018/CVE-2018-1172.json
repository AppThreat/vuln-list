  "details": [
    "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to deny service on vulnerable installations of The Squid Software Foundation Squid 3.5.27-20180318. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within ClientRequestContext::sslBumpAccessCheck(). A crafted request can trigger the dereference of a null pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition to users of the system. Was ZDI-CAN-6088.",
    "it was found that Squid, when used as a reverse proxy, did not handle ESI responses properly. A malicious web server could use this flaw to crash Squid."
