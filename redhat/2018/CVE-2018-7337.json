  "details": [
    "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.4, the DOCSIS protocol dissector could crash. This was addressed in plugins/docsis/packet-docsis.c by removing the recursive algorithm that had been used for concatenated PDUs.",
    "A denial of service flaw was found in the DOCSIS dissector in Wireshark. A remote network attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash Wireshark by tricking it into processing a crafted packet."
