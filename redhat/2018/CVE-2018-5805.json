  "details": [
    "A boundary error within the \"quicktake_100_load_raw()\" function (internal/dcraw_common.cpp) in LibRaw versions prior to 0.18.8 can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and subsequently cause a crash.",
    "LibRaw is vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow in internal/dcraw_common.cpp:quicktake_100_load_raw() function when processing specially-crafted RAW data. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to cause an arbitrary code execution or denial of service."
