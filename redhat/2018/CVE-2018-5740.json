    "\"deny-answer-aliases\" is a little-used feature intended to help recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model used by client browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c. Affects BIND 9.7.0-\u003e9.8.8, 9.9.0-\u003e9.9.13, 9.10.0-\u003e9.10.8, 9.11.0-\u003e9.11.4, 9.12.0-\u003e9.12.2, 9.13.0-\u003e9.13.2.",
    "A denial of service flaw was discovered in bind versions that include the \"deny-answer-aliases\" feature. This flaw may allow a remote attacker to trigger an INSIST assert in named leading to termination of the process and a denial of service condition."
