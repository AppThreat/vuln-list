    "The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) prior to version 1.2.3 does not properly bounds check the data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer, if an attribute length is invalid. Arbitrary data from the bgpd process may be sent over the network to a peer and/or bgpd may crash.",
    "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was discovered in Quagga. A BGP peer could send a specially crafted message which would cause Quagga to read out of bounds, potentially causing a crash or disclosure of up to 64KB process memory to the peer."
