    "Python Software Foundation Python (CPython) version 2.7 contains a CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in shutil module (make_archive function) that can result in Denial of service, Information gain via injection of arbitrary files on the system or entire drive. This attack appear to be exploitable via Passage of unfiltered user input to the function. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in after commit add531a1e55b0a739b0f42582f1c9747e5649ace.",
    "It was discovered that the shutil module of python does not properly sanitize input when creating a zip file on Windows. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or add unintended files to the generated archive."
