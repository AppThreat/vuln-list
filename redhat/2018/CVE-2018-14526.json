  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in rsn_supp/wpa.c in wpa_supplicant 2.0 through 2.6. Under certain conditions, the integrity of EAPOL-Key messages is not checked, leading to a decryption oracle. An attacker within range of the Access Point and client can abuse the vulnerability to recover sensitive information."
