    "In ZZIPlib 0.13.67, there is a memory alignment error and bus error in the __zzip_fetch_disk_trailer function of zzip/zip.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted zip file.",
    "An unaligned memory access bug was found in the way ZZIPlib handled ZIP files. This flaw could potentially be used to crash the application using ZZIPlib by tricking the application into processing specially crafted ZIP files."
