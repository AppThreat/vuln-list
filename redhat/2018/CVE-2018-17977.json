  "name": "CVE-2018-17977",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "The Linux kernel 4.14.67 mishandles certain interaction among XFRM Netlink messages, IPPROTO_AH packets, and IPPROTO_IP packets, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and system hang) by leveraging root access to execute crafted applications, as demonstrated on CentOS 7.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of complex interactions between netlink, IP, and AH style packets which can enter a state where the used memory will not be freed. This can eventually use all memory and possibly crash userspace programs due to lack of available memory."
