For all subsequent versions of OCP until 3.11, docker is installed from the RHEL Extras repository meaning clusters will be vulnerable to the flaw unless an updated docker package has been applied.\nRed Hat Fuse provides only the Docker client library and is not affected by this vulnerability.",

  "name": "CVE-2018-15664",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).",
    "A flaw was discovered in the API endpoint behind the 'docker cp' command. The endpoint is vulnerable to a Time Of Check to Time Of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in the way it handles symbolic links inside a container. An attacker who has compromised an existing container can cause arbitrary files on the host filesystem to be read/written when an administrator tries to copy a file from/to the container."
