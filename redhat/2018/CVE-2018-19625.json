  "details": [
    "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the dissection engine could crash. This was addressed in epan/tvbuff_composite.c by preventing a heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "An out of bounds heap read vulnerability in the dissection engine could allow Wireshark to crash when parsing a specially crafted pcap file. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service to Wireshark by injecting malicious packets into the network that are automatically processed."
