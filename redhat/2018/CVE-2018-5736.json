  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An error in zone database reference counting can lead to an assertion failure if a server which is running an affected version of BIND attempts several transfers of a slave zone in quick succession. This defect could be deliberately exercised by an attacker who is permitted to cause a vulnerable server to initiate zone transfers (for example: by sending valid NOTIFY messages), causing the named process to exit after failing the assertion test. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.",
    "A flaw was found in the way zone databases were handled by bind. An attacker with permissions to initiate a zone transfer could cause bind to crash."
