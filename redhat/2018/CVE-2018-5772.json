  "details": [
    "In Exiv2 0.26, there is a segmentation fault caused by uncontrolled recursion in the Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure function in the image.cpp file. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted tif file.",
    "An unbounded recursion flaw was found in the way Exiv2 handled certain image files. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash the exiv2 CLI utility program by tricking it into processing crafted input files."
