  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in zsh before 5.6. Shebang lines exceeding 64 characters were truncated, potentially leading to an execve call to a program name that is a substring of the intended one.",
    "It was discovered that zsh does not properly validate the shebang of input files and it truncates it to the first 64 bytes. A local attacker may use this flaw to make zsh execute a different binary than what is expected, named with a substring of the shebang one."
