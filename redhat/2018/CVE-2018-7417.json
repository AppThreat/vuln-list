    "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.12 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.4, the IPMI dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ipmi-picmg.c by adding support for crafted packets that lack an IPMI header.",
    "A denial of service flaw was found in the IPMI dissector in Wireshark. A remote network attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash Wireshark by tricking it into processing a crafted packet."
