    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: While parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, it is possible to do a one-byte overread. This would result in an incorrect text display of the certificate. This bug has been present since 2006 and is present in all versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw only exhibits itself when:\n1. OpenSSL is used to display details of a local or a remote certificate.\n2. The certificate contains the uncommon RFC 3779 IPAddressFamily extension.\n\nThe maximum impact of this flaw is garbled information being displayed, there is no impact on the availability of service using such a certificate. Also this flaw can NOT be used to create specially-crafted certificates. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
