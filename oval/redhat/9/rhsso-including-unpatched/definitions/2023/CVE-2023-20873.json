    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Spring Boot. This targets specifically 'spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure' package. This issue occurs when an application is deployed to Cloud Foundry, which could be susceptible to a security bypass.\n\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:\n\n         * You have code that can handle requests that match /cloudfoundryapplication/**. Typically, this will be if there is a catch-all request mapping which matches /**.\n         * The application is deployed to Cloud Foundry.\n\nAn application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:\n\n          * The application is not deployed to Cloud Foundry\n          * You have disabled Cloud Foundry actuator endpoints with management.cloudfoundry.enabled set to false.\n          * Your application does not have handler mappings that can handle requests to /cloudfoundryapplication/**. \n            STATEMENT: The following Red Hat products do not ship the affected software component and so are not affected:\n\n         * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 9\n         * Enterprise Application Platform 6, 7, 8, XP\n         * Data Grid 7, 8\n         * Migration Toolkit for Runtimes\n         * Red Hat Build of OptaPlanner\n         * Red Hat Integration Camel-K\n         * Red Hat AMQ Broker 7\n         * Red Hat AMQ Clients 2\n         * Red Hat AMQ Streams 2\n         * Red Hat Fuse 6\n         * Red Hat Fuse 7\n         * Red Hat VertX 4\n\nThe following Red Hat products ship the affected software but do not enable or do not ship the vulnerable classes, and so are affected but at Low security impact.\n\n         * Red Hat Decision Manager 7\n         * Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7\n         * Red Hat Single Sign-On 7\n            MITIGATION: Disable Cloud Foundry actuator endpoints by setting 'management.cloudfoundry.enabled' to false.",
