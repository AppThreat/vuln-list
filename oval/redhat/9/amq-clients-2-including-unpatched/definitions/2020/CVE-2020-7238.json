    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Netty, where it mishandles Transfer-Encoding whitespace. This flaw allows HTTP Request Smuggling. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform ships a vulnerable netty library as part of the logging-elasticsearch5 container. ElasticSearch's security team has stated that the previous vulnerability, CVE-2019-16869, does not poses a substantial practical threat to ElasticSearch 6 [1]. We agree that this issue would be difficult to exploit both these vulnerabilities on OpenShift Container Platform, so we're reducing the impact of this issue to moderate and may fix it in the future release.\n\nRed Hat Satellite ships vulnerable netty version embedded in Candlepin, however, is not directly vulnerable since HTTP requests are handled by Tomcat and not netty.\n\n[1]  https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49396\n            MITIGATION: * Use HTTP/2 instead (clear boundaries between requests)\n* Disable reuse of backend connections eg. ```http-reuse never``` in HAProxy or whatever equivalent LB settings",
