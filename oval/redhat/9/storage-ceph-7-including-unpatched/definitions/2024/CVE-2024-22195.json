    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A  cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Jinja2 due to the xmlattr filter allowing keys with spaces, contrary to XML/HTML attribute standards. If an application accepts user-input keys and renders them for other users, attackers can inject additional attributes, potentially leading to XSS. This misuse of the xmlattr filter enables the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes, bypassing auto-escaping and potentially circumventing attribute validation checks. \n            STATEMENT: The identified issue is classified as moderate due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Jinja2. This flaw arises from the xmlattr filter, which permits keys with spaces, contrary to XML/HTML attribute standards. In scenarios where an application accepts user-input keys and renders them for other users, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject additional attributes, potentially resulting in XSS attacks. The misuse of the xmlattr filter facilitates the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes, allowing attackers to bypass auto-escaping mechanisms and potentially evade attribute validation checks, posing a moderate security risk.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
