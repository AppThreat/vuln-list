    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: The Pallets Project flask version Before 0.12.3 contains a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in flask that can result in Large amount of memory usage possibly leading to denial of service. This attack appear to be exploitable via Attacker provides JSON data in incorrect encoding. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 0.12.3. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2019-1010083. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of python-flask as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nAlthough Red Hat Satellite 6 contains the vulnerable component, the former is not affected due to python-flask only receiving JSON data created by other Red Hat Satellite 6 components, not user-controlled JSON data, which makes the attack unfeasible.",
