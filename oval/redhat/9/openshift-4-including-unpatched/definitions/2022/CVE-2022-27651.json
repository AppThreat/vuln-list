    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in buildah, where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty default permissions. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities. This flaw allows an attacker with access to programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set when execve(2) runs. \n            STATEMENT: This issue is related to the general vulnerability found in Moby (Docker Engine), which has been assigned CVE-2022-24769.\n\nThe impact for OpenShift Container Platform is set to LOW as Buildah was shipped but is not being used. No update is planned at this time.\n            MITIGATION: The entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like capsh(1) to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",
