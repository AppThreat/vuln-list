    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Commons Configuration's variable interpolation, which by default included several lookup actions that could permit script invocation on remote servers. This issue could allow an attacker to use one of these actions to send a request to execute arbitrary code on the server. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite embeds affected commons-configuration2 with Candlepin, however, product is not affected since vulnerable org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol.Lookup is not exposed in code. Product Security has rated this vulnerability Low for Satellite and there is no harm identified to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
