    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where an authorized user may be able to redirect traffic to private networks on a Node. An untrusted user could exploit this by creating or modifying EndpointSlices to point to localhost or link-local addresses. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11 is not affected by this vulnerability as it does not support EndpointSlices. All current versions of OCP 4 support EndpointSlices and are therefore affected.\n            MITIGATION: * Prevent untrusted users from creating or modifying EndpointSlices\n* Creating a validating admission webhook that prevents EndpointSlices with endpoint addresses in the 127.0.0.0/8 and 169.254.0.0/16 ranges",
