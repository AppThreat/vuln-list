    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: For Eclipse Jetty versions \u003c= 9.4.40, \u003c= 10.0.2, \u003c= 11.0.2, it is possible for requests to the ConcatServlet with a doubly encoded path to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. For example a request to `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the hive/presto/hadoop components that comprise the OCP metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of jetty.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight will not be updated for this flaw because it was deprecated as of OpenStack Platform 14 and is only receiving security fixes for Important and Critical flaws.\n\nRed Hat CodeReady Studio 12 is not affected by this flaw because it does not ship the vulnerable components (ConcatServlet or WelcomeFilter) of jetty.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw because it does not ship the vulnerable components (ConcatServlet or WelcomeFilter) of jetty.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ships the vulnerable component of jetty, but only in the optional repository and thus this flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.",
