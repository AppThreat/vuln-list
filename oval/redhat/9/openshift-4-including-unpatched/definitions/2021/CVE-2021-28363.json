    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-urllib3. SSL certificate validation is omitted in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted. \n            STATEMENT: * Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 delivers the python-urllib3 package which includes a vulnerable version of urllib3 module, however from OCP 4.6 the python-urllib3 package is no longer shipped. OCP 4.5 is out of support scope for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities, hence is marked Out Of Support Scope.\n\n* Red Hat CodeReady WorkSpaces 2 and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 are not affected by this flaw because both the products does not ship a vulnerable version of urllib3.",
