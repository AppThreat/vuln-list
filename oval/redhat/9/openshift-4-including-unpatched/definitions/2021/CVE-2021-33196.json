    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in archive/zip of the Go standard library. Applications written in Go can panic or potentially exhaust system memory when parsing malformed ZIP files. \n            STATEMENT: * In OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Service Mesh, multiple components are written in Go and use archive/zip from the standard library. However, all such components are short lived client side tools, not long lived server side executables. As the maximum impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service in client utilities, this vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Plaform and OpenShift Service Mesh.\n\n* Although OpenShift distributed tracing (formerly OpenShift Jaeger) components are compiled with a vulnerable version of Go,  the vulnerable archive/zip package is currently not used by this product therefore these components are affected but with impact Low. Additionally only core OpenShift distributed tracing components have been listed.\n\n* Although Serverless does ship the affected package, it does not make use of the actual package and hence the impact is low.\n\n* Because Service Telemetry Framework1.2 will be retiring soon and the flaw's impact is lower, no update will be provided at this time for STF1.2's smart-gateway-container and sg-core-container.",
