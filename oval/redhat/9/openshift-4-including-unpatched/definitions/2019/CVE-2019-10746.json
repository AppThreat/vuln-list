    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Nodejs's mixin-deep prior to versions 1.3.2 and 2.0.0. The mixin-deep function could be used to add or modify properties of the Object.prototype. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, nodejs-mixin-deep is bundled into nodejs-nodemon, and is not meant to be accessed outside of that package. Within nodemon, this flaw is rated with a Low severity.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenShift Logging the openshift-logging/kibana6-rhel8 container bundles many nodejs packages as a build time dependencies, including the mixin-deep package. \nThe vulnerable code is not used hence the impact to OpenShift Logging by this vulnerability is Low.",
