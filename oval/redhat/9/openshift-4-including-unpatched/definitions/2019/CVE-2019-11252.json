    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Kubernetes that allows the logging of credentials when mounting AzureFile and CephFS volumes. This flaw allows an attacker to access kubelet logs, read the credentials, and use them to access other services. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) included the upstream patch for this flaw in the release of version 4.5. Prior versions are affected as OCP 4 supports AzureFile volumes and OCP 3 supports both AzureFile and CephFS volumes. OCP clusters not using these volume types are not vulnerable.",
