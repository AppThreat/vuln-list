    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An arbitrary code execution flaw was found in Kibana in versions prior to 5.6.15 and 6.6.1. If a Kibana instance has the setting xpack.security.audit.enabled set to true, an attacker could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0/9.0 Operational Tools Kibana/Elasticsearch versions do not include nor support X-Pack (8/9 versions must use the optional Shield, also not packaged); not affected.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, and 3.x do not install the vulnerable package (Shield for Kibana 4, and X-Pack for Kibana 5), so the impact is lowered to moderate.",
