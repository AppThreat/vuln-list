    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in runc. An attacker who controls the container image for two containers that share a volume can race volume mounts during container initialization, by adding a symlink to the rootfs that points to a directory on the volume. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: For Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because runc is not directly used by the director-operator, no update will be provided at this time for the operator containers.",
