    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was discovered in the ruamel.yaml library, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the load() method. Applications that use ruamel.yaml to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/apply constructor. \n            STATEMENT: While the openshift-logging-curator5-container contains the vulnerable code, and method call, it only uses it to load a configuration file, which can be considered trusted data. Therefore this component of OpenShift Container Platform is not affected.\n\nThe python-openshift the dependency of OpenShift Container Platform is only used in a deprecated and unused build script (that is removed in later versions), and does not pose a risk to consumers of this library. Therefore it will not be fixed.\n            MITIGATION: Use the 'safe_load' method in place of 'load' if loading untrusted data. Alternatively use:\nyaml=YAML(typ='safe') \nyaml.load()\n\nReference: https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basicuse.html",
