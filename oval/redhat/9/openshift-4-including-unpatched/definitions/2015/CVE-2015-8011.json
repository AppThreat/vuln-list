    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A buffer overflow was found in the lldp_decode function in daemon/protocols/lldp.c in lldpd. This flaw allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving large management addresses and TLV boundaries. This threatens the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. \n            STATEMENT: The lldpd package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw because it has already received the patch. The flaw affects versions before 0.8.0 and the shipped version is 1.0.1+. In addition, Red Hat Virtualization 4.3 manager appliance is out of support scope and therefore no fix for it will be delivered.\n            MITIGATION: When the lldpd source is compiled with source fortification enabled, the flaw becomes unexploitable and will just cause a crash.",
