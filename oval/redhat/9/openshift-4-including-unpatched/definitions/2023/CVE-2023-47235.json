    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An issue was found in FRRouting FRR, where a crash may occur when processing a malformed BGP UPDATE message with an EOR. \n            STATEMENT: A moderate severity issue has been identified in FRRouting FRR, where a crash may occur when processing a malformed BGP UPDATE message with an EOR. It's important to note that Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) is not directly affected, as it utilises the version from the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is marked as Not Affected, with no changes required by the OpenStack engineering team. However, system administrators of OpenStack deployments are advised to apply updates once available in RHEL to mitigate potential risks. Additionally, this flaw is discovered through fuzzing, where, in normal cases, such packets cannot exist.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
