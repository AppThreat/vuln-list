    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jetty http2-hpack and http3-qpack. If header values exceed the size limit and Huffman is the true`MetaDataBuilder.checkSize`, the multiplication will overflow, and the length will become negative, causing a large buffer allocation on the server, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw requires a remote attacker to repeatedly send HTTP requests with HPACK, which could easily impact the server's performance or make it run out of memory. Hence, this vulnerability received an Important impact rating.\n            MITIGATION: No mitigations are currently available for this vulnerability.",
