    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissions of temporary files it created so that only the current user was allowed to access them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file and created a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying the effort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process. \n            STATEMENT: ant as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw because this flaw is caused by the patch for CVE-2020-1945, however, it was never applied to ant as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, because the decision was made by Engineering to WONTFIX that flaw.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of ant package.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated",
