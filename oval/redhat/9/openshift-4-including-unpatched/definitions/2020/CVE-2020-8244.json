    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in bl \u003c4.0.3, \u003c3.0.1, \u003c2.2.1, and \u003c1.2.3 which could allow an attacker to supply user input (even typed) that if it ends up in consume() argument and can become negative, the BufferList state can be corrupted, tricking it into exposing uninitialized memory via regular .slice() calls. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 delivers the kibana package where the nodejs-bl module is used, but during the update to container first (to openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6) the dependency was removed and hence kibana package is marked as wontfix. This may be fixed in the future.",
