    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Kubernetes API server, where it allows an attacker to escalate their privileges from a compromised node. This flaw allows an attacker who can intercept requests on a compromised node, to redirect those requests, along with their credentials, to perform actions on other endpoints that trust those credentials (including other clusters), allowing for escalation of privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Kubernetes is embedded in the version of heketi shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3. However, it does not use Kubernetes API server part and only uses client side bits. Hence, this flaw does not affect heketi.\n            MITIGATION: No mitigation is known.",
