    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the python-rsa package, where it does not explicitly check the ciphertext length against the key size and ignores the leading 0 bytes during the decryption of the ciphertext. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a ciphertext attack, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-rsa package.",
