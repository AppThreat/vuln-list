    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-urllib3. The HTTPConnection.request() does not properly validate CRLF sequences in the HTTP request method, potentially allowing manipulation of the request by injecting additional HTTP headers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: * Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 delivers the python-urllib3 package, which includes a vulnerable version of the urllib3 module, however from OCP 4.6, the python-urllib3 package is no longer shipped and will not be fixed.\n* In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-urllib3 package.\n\nNote: Versions of `python-pip` are marked as not affected because there is no way for a pip user to control the HTTP request method.",
