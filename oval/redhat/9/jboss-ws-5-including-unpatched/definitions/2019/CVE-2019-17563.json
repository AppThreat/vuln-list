    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that tomcat's FORM authentication allowed a very small period in which an attacker could possibly force a victim to use a valid user session, or Session Fixation. While practical exploit of this issue is deemed highly improbable, an abundance of caution merits it be considered a flaw. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability, but also threatens data confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: All affected Red Hat products providing the affected component code should update their setups per the product fixes given.\n\nThe following Red Hat products are out of support scope for Low Impact flaws, and as such will not issue security fixes:\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6\nRed Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6\nRed Hat JBoss BRMS 6",
