    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. If a process can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows an unprivileged attacker to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether. \n            STATEMENT: While the vulnerability in Unbound's default permissions presents a significant security concern, it may not necessarily be classified as a critical severity issue but rather as an important one due to several factors. Firstly, the vulnerability requires local access to the system, limiting its exploitability compared to critical vulnerabilities that can be remotely exploited. Additionally, the impact of the vulnerability, while potentially severe in terms of allowing unauthorized modification of Unbound's configuration and potential disruption of DNS resolution, may not directly lead to immediate and widespread compromise of sensitive data or critical system functionality. However, it remains important due to the potential for privacy violations, redirection of traffic, and disruption of services, especially considering the central role of DNS in network communication.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
