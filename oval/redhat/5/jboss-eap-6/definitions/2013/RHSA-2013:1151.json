    "Description": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way authenticated connections were cached on\nthe server by remote-naming. After a user has successfully logged in, a\nremote attacker could use a remoting client to log in as that user without\nknowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform actions\nwith the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-4128)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way connections for remote EJB invocations via\nthe EJB client API were cached on the server. After a user has successfully\nlogged in, a remote attacker could use an EJB client to log in as that user\nwithout knowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform\nactions with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-4213)\n\nThese issues were discovered by Wolf-Dieter Fink of the Red Hat GSS Team.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss\nEnterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
