    "Description": "Apache CXF is an open source services framework.\n\nIt was found that the Apache CXF UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and\nUsernameTokenInterceptor allowed a UsernameToken element with no password\nchild element to bypass authentication. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to circumvent access controls applied to web services by omitting the\npassword in a UsernameToken. This flaw was exploitable on web services that\nrely on WS-SecurityPolicy plain text UsernameTokens to authenticate users.\nIt was not exploitable when using hashed passwords or WS-Security without\nWS-SecurityPolicy. (CVE-2013-0239)\n\nIf web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor\nenabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these\nservices were always granted access, without applying authentication\nchecks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing\nREST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple\nSOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints\napplied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if\nWSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that\nuse WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss\nEnterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
