    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-y18n. There is a prototype pollution vulnerability in y18n's locale functionality. If an attacker is able to provide untrusted input via locale, they may be able to cause denial of service or in rare circumstances, impact to data integrity or confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) and OpenShift distributed tracing the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable nodejs-y18n library to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is Low.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4 the noobaa-core container includes the affected version of y18n as a dependency of yargs. However, no unsafe usage found where the module accepts untrusted input and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.",
