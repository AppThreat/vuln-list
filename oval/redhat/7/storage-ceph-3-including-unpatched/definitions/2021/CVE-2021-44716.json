    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: There's an uncontrolled resource consumption flaw in golang's net/http library in the canonicalHeader() function. An attacker who submits specially crafted requests to applications linked with net/http's http2 functionality could cause excessive resource consumption that could lead to a denial of service or otherwise impact to system performance and resources. \n            STATEMENT: For OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Virtualization, Red Hat Quay and OpenShift distributed tracing the most an attacker can possibly achieve by exploiting this vulnerability is to crash a container, temporarily impacting availability of one or more services. Therefore impact is rated Moderate.\n\nIn its default configuration, grafana as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this vulnerability. However, enabling http2 in /etc/grafana/grafana.ini explicitly would render grafana affected, therefore grafana has been marked affected.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw can be mitigated by disabling HTTP/2. Setting the GODEBUG=http2server=0 environment variable before calling Serve will disable HTTP/2 unless it was manually configured through the golang.org/x/net/http2 package.",
