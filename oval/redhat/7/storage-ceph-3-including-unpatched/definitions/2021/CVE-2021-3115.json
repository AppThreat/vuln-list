    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in golang: cmd/go, in which Go can execute arbitrary commands at build time when cgo is in use on Windows OS. On Linux/Unix, only users who have \".\" listed explicitly in their PATH variable are affected. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: While OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger (RHOSJ),  OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM)  and OpenShift Virtualization all contain RPMs and containers which are compiled with a vulnerable version of Go, the vulnerability is specific to the building of Go code itself.  Hence the relevant components have been marked as not affected.\n\nAdditionally, only the main RPMs and containers for OCP, RHOSJ, OSSM and OpenShift Virtualization are represented due to the large volume of not affected components.\n            MITIGATION: The flaw can be mitigated by making sure \".\" is not in your PATH environment variable.",
