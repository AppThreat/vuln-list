    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in django. On Python 3.9.5+, `URLValidator` didn't prohibited newlines and tabs which could lead to a header injection attack if these were used in an HTTP response. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: * Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 ships an old version of Django (v1.11.27) that provides support for Python 3.7, hence not affected by this vulnerability.\n* Red Hat Satellite and Red Hat Update Infrastructure ships affected versions of Django, however, products make use of Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 consumed from RHEL repository. Successful exploitation would require Support to Python version 3.9.5 onward hence products are not affected by this vulnerability.\n* Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 2 and 3 ship an affected version of Django.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update as soon as possible.",
