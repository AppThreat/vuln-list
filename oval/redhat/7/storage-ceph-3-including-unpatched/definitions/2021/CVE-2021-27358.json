    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Grafana. The snapshot feature allows unauthenticated remote attackers to trigger a denial of service (DoS) via a remote API call if anonymous access is enabled. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: While in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) there is shipped a vulnerable version of grafana, access to the grafana panel is behind OpenShift OAuth proxy and requires admin permissions. Therefore these components are affected but with impact Low.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 does not ship the directly affected code, however, they are still affected by this vulnerability because it allows the same configuration of anonymous snapshots, hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.",
