    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in HTTP/2. Using PING frames and queuing of response PING ACK frames, a flood attack could occur resulting in unbounded memory growth. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: The golang package in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 Operational Tools will not be updated for this flaw because it is in technical preview and is retiring as of 24.Aug.2019.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of grafana(embeds golang) as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 as they did not include the support for HTTP/2.\nThe following storage product versions are affected because they include the support for HTTP/2 in:\n* golang as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3\n* heketi(embeds golang) as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3\n* grafana(embeds golang and grpc) as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 3\nThis flaw has no available mitigation for packages golang and nodejs. Both packages will be updated once the available fixes are released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections.\n\nThe nodejs RPM shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 and 3.10 is not affected by this flaw as it does not contain the vulnerable code.\n\nAll OpenShift Container Platform RPMs and container images that are built with Go and support HTTP/2 are vulnerable to this flaw.",
