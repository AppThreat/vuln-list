    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was found on Grafana Teams APIs. This flaw impacts the `/teams/:teamId`, `/teams/:search`, `/teams/:teamId/members` API endpoints and may allow an authenticated attacker to view unintended data by querying for the specific team ID or search for teams and see the total number of available teams (including teams that the user does not have access to). \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
