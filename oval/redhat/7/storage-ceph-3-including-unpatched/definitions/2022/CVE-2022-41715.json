    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the golang package, where programs that compile regular expressions from untrusted sources are vulnerable to memory exhaustion or a denial of service. The parsed regexp representation is linear in the input size. Still, in some cases, the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making a relatively small regexp consume larger amounts of memory. After the fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected. Routine use of regular expressions is unaffected. \n            STATEMENT: The opportunity for a Denial of Service is limited to the golang runtime. In the case of OpenShift Container Platform, this would be restricted within each individual container. There are multiple layers of guide rails (Golang’s Garbage Collector; OpenShift’s resource constraints imposed at the container and cluster levels) which would require a malicious user to continue submitting attacks for there to be any enduring impact. They would also need access to external server resources to be able to send a massive volume of requests to cause a significant impact on server operations.",
