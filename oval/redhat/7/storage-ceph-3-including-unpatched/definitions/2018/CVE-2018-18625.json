    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in grafana. An incomplete fix for CVE-2018-12099 allows for a XSS via a column style on the \"Dashboard \u003e All Panels \u003e General\" screen. \n            STATEMENT: While OpenShift 3.11 grafana-container packages a vulnerable version of grafana, the dashboard is set to read-only meaning that the vulnerable component cannot be added or modified to contain the potential XSS. As OpenShift still packages the vulnerable code, the component is affected but with impact Low.\n\nIn OpenShift ServiceMesh 1.0 the grafana component is a vulnerable version, however as it is behind OpenShift OAuth restricting access to authenticated users only the impact is Low.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw, as it ships a newer version of grafana which does not include the vulnerable code.",
