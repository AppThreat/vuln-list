    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A Prototype Pollution vulnerability was found in lodash. Calling certain methods with untrusted JSON could lead to modifying objects up the prototype chain, including the global Object. A crafted JSON object passed to a vulnerable method could lead to denial of service or data injection, with various consequences. \n            STATEMENT: The lodash dependency is included in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) by Kibana in the aggregated logging stack. Elastic have issued a security advisory (ESA-2019-10) for Kibana for this vulnerability, and in that advisory stated that no exploit vectors had been identified in Kibana. Therefore we rate this issue as moderate for OCP and may fix this issue in a future release.\n\nhttps://www.elastic.co/community/security\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of rh-nodejs8-nodejs and  rh-nodejs10-nodejs  as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections.\n\nWhilst a vulnerable version of lodash has been included in ServiceMesh, the impact is lowered to Moderate due to the library not being directly accessible increasing the attack complexity and the fact that the attacker would need some existing access - meaning the vulnerability is not crossing a privilege boundary.\n\nRed Hat Quay imports lodash as a runtime dependency of restangular. The restangular function in use by Red Hat Quay do not use lodash to parse user input. This issue therefore rated moderate impact for Red Hat Quay.",
