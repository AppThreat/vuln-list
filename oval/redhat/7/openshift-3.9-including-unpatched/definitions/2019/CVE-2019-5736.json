    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the way runc handled system file descriptors when running containers. A malicious container could use this flaw to overwrite contents of the runc binary and consequently run arbitrary commands on the container host system. \n            STATEMENT: The 'docker' package shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras bundles 'runc' since 'docker' starting from version 1.12. Both the 'docker' and 'runc' packages are affected by this issue.\n\nThe 'docker-latest' package is deprecated as of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5. Customers using this package should update to the latest 'docker' package shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.\n\nOpenShift Container Platform (OCP) versions 3.9 and later use 'docker' version 1.13 in the default configuration but can be configured to use CRI-O as an alternative, which depends on the 'runc' package. OCP versions 3.9 and later should use the updated 'docker' and 'runc' packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.\n\nOCP versions 3.4 through 3.7 originally used 'docker' version 1.12 from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras channel. An updated version of 'docker' 1.12 has been delivered to the RPM channels for OCP versions 3.4 through 3.7.\n\nOCP version 3.9 previously shipped a version of 'runc' in it's RPM repository. OCP 3.9 clusters using CRI-O should update 'runc' from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras channel.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7 is not affected by this vulnerability as the target runc binaries are stored on a read-only filesystem and cannot be overwritten.\n            MITIGATION: This vulnerability is mitigated on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 if SELinux is in enforcing mode. SELinux in enforcing mode is a pre-requisite for OpenShift Container Platform 3.x.",
