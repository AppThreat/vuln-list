    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that curl and libcurl might send their Authentication header to a third party HTTP server upon receiving an HTTP REDIRECT reply. This could leak authentication token to external entities.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7, as well as the versions of httpd24-curl as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n            MITIGATION: By default, curl and libcurl will not follow redirect requests.\nThis flaw happens only when curl or libcurl are explicitly requested to follow redirects (option --location in curl, and CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION in libcurl).\nTo mitigate this, it is possible to prevent the automated following of redirects, replacing it by manual redirects (and remove the authentication header), for example.",
