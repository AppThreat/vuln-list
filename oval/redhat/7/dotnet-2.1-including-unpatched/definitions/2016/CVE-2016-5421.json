    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A use-after-free flaw was found in libcurl. When invoking curl_easy_perform() after cleaning up a multi session, an application can be tricked into using libcurl to connect to a malicious server, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: The versions of `curl` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are marked as \"notaffected\" because they did not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a later version of the package. Specifically, the struct field affected by this flaw was introduced in `curl` upstream version 7.32.0. The version of `curl` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is 7.29.0.",
