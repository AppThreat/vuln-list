    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An improper Input validation flaw was found in Apache Tomcat due to incorrect parsing of HTTP trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single request as multiple requests, leading to the possibility of request smuggling when behind a reverse proxy. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in Apache Tomcat is of significant importance due to its potential to exploit HTTP request smuggling, presenting a security risk for web applications utilizing Tomcat. The flaw arises from Tomcat's improper parsing of HTTP trailer headers, where a specifically crafted header exceeding the size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single request as multiple ones. This opens the door for attackers to manipulate requests and potentially conduct various malicious activities, such as unauthorized access, data exposure, or other exploits, particularly when Tomcat is deployed behind a reverse proxy. \n\nThe pki-servlet-engine package has been obsoleted by the Tomcat package. Therefore, this issue will be fixed in the Tomcat package rather than the pki-serlvet-engine package. Please follow the RHEL Tomcat trackers instead for the updates.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
