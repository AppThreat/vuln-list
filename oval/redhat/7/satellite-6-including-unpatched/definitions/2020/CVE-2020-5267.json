    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-actionview. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks with ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms and Satellite ship affected RubyGem actionview with methods, however, those are not vulnerable since none of those uses template string enclosed with backtick characters. A future update may fix affected RubyGem.",
