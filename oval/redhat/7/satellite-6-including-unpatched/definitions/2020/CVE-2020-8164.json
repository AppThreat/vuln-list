    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-actionpack. Untrusted hashes of data is possible for values of `each`, `each_value`, and `each_pair` which can lead to cases of user supplied information being leaked from Strong Parameters. Applications that use these hashes may inadvertently use untrusted user input. The highest risk from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Satellite ship affected RubyGem actionpack and uses strong parameters, however, products are not vulnerable since safe return values are used in product code.",
