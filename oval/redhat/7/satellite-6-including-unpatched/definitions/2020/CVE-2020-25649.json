    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in FasterXML Jackson Databind, where it did not have entity expansion secured properly. This flaw allows vulnerability to XML external entity (XXE) attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data integrity. \n            STATEMENT: * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 ships a vulnerable version of jackson-databind in the pki-deps:10.6 module. pki-deps:10.6 is for pki-core dependencies, but pki-core does not use the vulnerable DOMDeserializer class and thus has been set to low impact. Future updates may include fixed version of jackson-databind.\n\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind code. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n\n* Red Hat Virtualization ships a vulnerable version of jackson-databind, however the vulnerable DOMDeserializer class is not used in the code, therefore reducing impact to low.\n\n* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) ships a vulnerable version of jackson-databind, but in the affected containers the DOMDeserializer class is not used. Additionally access to the containers is restricted to authenticated users only (OpenShift OAuth authentication) reducing the severity of this vulnerability to Low.\nIn OCP 4 there are no plans to maintain ose-logging-elasticsearch5 container, hence marked as wontfix.\n\n* Red Hat Satellite ships affected version of jackson-databind through Candlepin, however, product code does not use DOMDeserializer class and jackson-databind in a vulnerable way. Thus impact has been set to low. A future release may update jackson-databind to a fixed version.\n\n* Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) ships affected version of jackson-databind, however, none of the product code is using the affected class (DOMDeserializer). Thus impact has been set to low. RH-SSO will consume the fixed artifact from EAP in the next CP.\n            MITIGATION: There is currently no known mitigation for this flaw.",
