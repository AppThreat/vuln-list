    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in PyCryptodome/pycryptodomex which may allow for side-channel leakage when performing OAEP decryption, which could be exploited to carry out a Manger attack. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite ship affected version of pycryptodome for pulp_container, however, product is not vulnerable as it doesn't utilize OAEP algorithm technique. Red Hat Product Security has classified its impact as Low for Red Hat Satellite; future updates expected to address this issue.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack 16.1 and 16.2 versions include affected python-scciclient embedded through the python-crypto package, however, python-scciclient employs only one algorithm, which is AES. While the version of python-crypto we ship may be susceptible to a particular CVE, since affected algorithms are not utilized by OpenStack, the attack cannot be executed to exploit an OpenStack deployment",
