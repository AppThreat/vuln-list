    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Netty, specifically in the netty-codec-http package. This flaw allows unauthorized control characters at the beginning and end of a request, does not follow the specification, and can cause HTTP request smuggling. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of netty-codec-http package.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated, hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThe openshift4/ose-logging-elasticsearch6 container is marked as Out of support scope because since the release of OCP 4.7 the logging functionality is delivered as an OpenShift Logging product and OCP 4.6 is already in the Maintenance Support phase.\nA fix was introduced in netty-codec-http version 4.1.72.Final.",
