    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An improper authorization handling flaw was found in Foreman. The OpenSCAP plugin for the smart-proxy allows foreman clients to execute actions that should be limited to the Foreman Server. This flaw allows an authenticated local attacker to access and delete limited resources and also causes a denial of service on the Foreman server. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity and system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6 ship smart_proxy_openscap plugin which is affected by the flaw. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity and system availability.\n            MITIGATION: To mitigate the flaw, disable smart_proxy_openscap plugin from the Server. You can do that either by editing `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/openscap.yml` and restarting `systemctl restart foreman-proxy.service`, or by running `foreman-installer --no-enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-openscap` command.",
