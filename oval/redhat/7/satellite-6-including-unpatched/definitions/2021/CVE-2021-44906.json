    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption flaw was found in minimist. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the library into adding or modifying the properties of Object.prototype, using a constructor or __proto__ payload, resulting in prototype pollution and loss of confidentiality, availability, and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low on Red Hat Satellite 6 and is not currently planned to be addressed there, as the minimist library is included in the -doc subpackage only and is part of test fixtures that are not in the execution path used by the rabl gem.",
