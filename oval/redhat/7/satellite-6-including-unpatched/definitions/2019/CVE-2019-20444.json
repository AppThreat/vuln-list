    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A HTTP smuggling flaw was found in HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty in versions prior to version 4.1.44. HTTP headers with an invalid fold, in this case CRLF (carriage return, line feed) without being followed by SP (space) or HTAB (horizontal tab), result in situations where headers can be misread. Data integrity is the highest threat with this vulnerability.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform ships a vulnerable netty library as part of the logging-elasticsearch5 container. ElasticSearch's security team has stated that the previous vulnerability, CVE-2019-16869, does not pose a substantial practical threat to ElasticSearch 6. We agree that these issues would be difficult to exploit on OpenShift Container Platform so we're reducing the impact of this issue to moderate and may fix it in the future release.\n\nRed Hat Satellite ships a vulnerable version of netty embedded in Candlepin. However, the flaw can not be triggered in that context, because HTTP requests are handled by Tomcat, not by netty. A future release may fix this.\n            MITIGATION: * Use HTTP/2 instead (clear boundaries between requests)\n* Disable reuse of backend connections eg. ```http-reuse never``` in HAProxy or whatever equivalent LB settings",
