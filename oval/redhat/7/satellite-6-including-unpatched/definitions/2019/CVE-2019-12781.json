    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An HTTP detection flaw was discovered in Django.  If deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Django via HTTPS,  django.http.HttpRequest.scheme() incorrectly detected client requests made using HTTP as using HTTPS.  This resulted in incorrect results for is_secure() and build_absolute_uri(), and HTTP requests were not correctly redirected to HTTPS in accordance with SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT.\n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect any versions of python-django as shipped with Red Hat Update Infrastructure for Cloud Providers as the load balancer should not be configured to forward HTTP requests.",
