    "Description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Quick emulator (QEMU) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data via bitblt copy in backward mode. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of QEMU process on the host. (CVE-2017-2615)\n\n* Quick emulator (QEMU) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. The issue could occur while copying VGA data in cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process OR potentially execute arbitrary code on host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-2620)\n\n* An out-of-bounds read-access flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with IP checksum routines. The flaw could occur when computing a TCP/UDP packet's checksum, because a QEMU function used the packet's payload length without checking against the data buffer's size. A user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process (denial of service). (CVE-2016-2857)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Wjjzhang (Tencent.com Inc.) and Li Qiang (360.cn Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-2615 and Ling Liu (Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-2857.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Prior to this update, after migrating a guest virtual machine on the little-endian variant of IBM Power Systems and resetting the guest, the guest boot process failed with a \"tcmalloc: large alloc\" error message. This update fixes the bug, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1420456)\n\n* The qemu-kvm-rhev package depends on the usbredir and libcacard packages. However, on the little-endian variant of IBM Power Systems, smartcard use is not supported and usbredir and libcacard are thus only available in the Optional channel. As a consequence, qemu-kvm-rhev was previously not installable on these systems if the Optional channel was not available for the user. This update removes usbredir and libcacard as dependencies of qemu-kvm-rhev on little-endian IBM Power Systems, and qemu-kvm-rhev can now be installed as expected in the described scenario.
