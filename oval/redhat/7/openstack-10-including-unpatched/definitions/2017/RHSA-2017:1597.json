    "Description": "The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities. The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style logins.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-keystone (10.0.1). (BZ#1431715)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An authorization-check flaw was discovered in federation configurations of the OpenStack Identity service (keystone). An authenticated federated user could request permissions to a project and unintentionally be granted all related roles including administrative roles. (CVE-2017-2673)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Openstack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Boris Bobrov (Mail.Ru) as the original reporter.",
