    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A deserialization flaw was discovered in Apache Tomcat's use of a FileStore. Under specific circumstances, an attacker can use a specially crafted request to trigger Remote Code Execution through deserialization of the file under their control. The highest threat from the vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, Red Hat Certificate System 10 and Identity Management are using the pki-servlet-engine component, which embeds a vulnerable version of Tomcat. However, in these specific contexts, the prerequisites to the vulnerability are not met. The PersistentManager is not set, and a SecurityManager is used. The use of pki-servlet-engine outside of these contexts is not supported. As a result, the vulnerability can not be triggered in supported configurations of these products. A future update may update Tomcat in pki-servlet-engine.\n\nRed Hat Satellite do not ship Tomcat and rather use its configuration. The product is not affected because configuration does not make use of PersistanceManager or FileStore. Tomcat updates can be obtain from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) RHSA.\n            MITIGATION: Users may configure the PersistenceManager with an appropriate value for sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter to ensure that only application provided attributes are serialized and deserialized.  For more details about the configuration, refer to the Apache Tomcat 9 Configuration Reference https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/manager.html.",
