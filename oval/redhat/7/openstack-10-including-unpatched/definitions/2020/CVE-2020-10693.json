    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Hibernate Validator version 6.1.2.Final. A bug in the message interpolation processor enables invalid EL expressions to be evaluated as if they were valid. This flaw allows attackers to bypass input sanitation (escaping, stripping) controls that developers may have put in place when handling user-controlled data in error messages. \n            STATEMENT: hibernate-validator is packaged with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0's OpenDaylight (ODL). However, because ODL is technical preview in this version and the flaw is moderate, Red Hat will not be releasing a fix for the OpenStack package at this time.\n            MITIGATION: You can pass user input as an expression variable by unwrapping the context to HibernateConstraintValidatorContext. Please refer to the https://in.relation.to/2020/05/07/hibernate-validator-615-6020-released/ and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#_the_code_constraintvalidatorcontext_code.",
