    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A directory traversal vulnerability was found in the Rack::Directory app that is bundled with Rack. If certain directories exist in a director managed by the Rack::Directory, this flaw allows an attacker to read the contents of files on the server outside of the root specified in the Rack::Directory initializer. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: Because the following products package the flawed code, but do not use its functionality (Rack::Directory), their impact has been reduced to 'Low':\n* Red Hat CloudForms\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 Operational Tools\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage 3\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 ships the affected version of RubyGem Rack and is vulnerable to the flaw. However,  because attackers require shell access to exploit the vulnerability, Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having the security impact of Low for Satellite. A future update might address this issue.",
