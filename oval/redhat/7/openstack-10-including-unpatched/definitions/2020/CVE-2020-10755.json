    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An insecure-credentials flaw was found in openstack-cinder. When using openstack-cinder with the Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver, credentials for the entire backend are exposed in the ``connection_info`` element in all Block Storage v3 Attachments API calls containing that element. This flaw enables an end-user to create a volume, make an API call to show the attachment detail information, and retrieve a username and password that may be used to connect to another user's volume. Additionally, these credentials are valid for the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discover the Management API endpoint.  Source: OpenStack project \n            STATEMENT: In addition to the software updates for this flaw, you must deploy a new configuration file on compute nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your deployment.  For detailed information, refer to referenced article.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
