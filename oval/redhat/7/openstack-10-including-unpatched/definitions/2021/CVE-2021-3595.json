    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the tftp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'tftp_t' structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw affects the versions of SLiRP embedded in `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and RHEL Advanced Virtualization. A future update may address this issue. It is worth noting that although `qemu-kvm` is built with SLiRP networking support, due to its limitations, it is not used by the virtual machine guests by default.",
