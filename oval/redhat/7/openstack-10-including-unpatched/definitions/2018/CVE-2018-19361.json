    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in jackson-databind, where it would permit polymorphic deserialization of a malicious object using the OpenJPA class. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since its candlepin component doesn't bundle openjpa jar.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization 4 is not affected by this issue, since its candlepin component doesn't bundle openjpa jar.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.",
