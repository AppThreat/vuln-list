    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Bootstrap, where it is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the affix configuration target property. This flaw allows a remote attacker to execute a script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, which can lead to stealing the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms 4.6 and newer versions include the vulnerable component, but there is no risk of exploitation, since there is no possible vector to access the vulnerability. Older Red Hat CloudForms versions do not use the vulnerable component at all.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization 4.2 EUS contains the affected version of bootstrap in the packages ovirt-js-dependencies and ovirt-engine-dashboard. These packages are deprecated in Red Hat Virtualization 4.3.",
