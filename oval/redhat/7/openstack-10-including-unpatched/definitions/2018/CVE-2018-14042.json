    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Bootstrap before 4.1.2, XSS is possible in the data-container property of tooltip. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6.2 and newer versions don't use the bootstrap library, hence are not affected by this flaw.\n\nRed Hat CloudForms 4.6 and newer versions include the vulnerable component, but there is no risk of exploitation, since there is no possible vector to access the vulnerability. Older Red Hat CloudForms versions don't use the vulnerable component at all.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Satellite 5 is now in Maintenance Support 2 phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Satellite 5 Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite.",
