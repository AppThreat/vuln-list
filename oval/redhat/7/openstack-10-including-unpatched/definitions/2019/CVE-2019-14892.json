    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: A flaw was discovered in jackson-databind in versions before 2.9.10, 2.8.11.5 and 2.6.7.3, where it would permit polymorphic deserialization of a malicious object using commons-configuration 1 and 2 JNDI classes. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. \n            STATEMENT: Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic unmarshmalling, which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n\nWhile OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.",
