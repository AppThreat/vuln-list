    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input. (This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states \"only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk.\" \n            STATEMENT: As per upstream this flaw cannot be exploited under normal documented use of the LZ4 library API. Also this flaw is only present in the lz4 library and the application binaries shipped with this application are not affected by it. \n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform 10 packages an older version of lz4 that has the flawed code. However, because OpenStack has been using RHEL's updated lz4 version since RHEL7.5 started to include it, Red Hat is not currently updating the OpenStack lz4 package.",
