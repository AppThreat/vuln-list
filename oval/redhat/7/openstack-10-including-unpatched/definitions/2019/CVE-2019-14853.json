    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An error-handling flaw was found in python-ecdsa.  During signature decoding, malformed DER signatures could raise unexpected exceptions (or no exceptions at all), which could lead to a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Although Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships the flawed code, RHOSP does not actually use python-ecdsa's functionality. As such, Red Hat OpenStack Platform will not be providing a fix for python-ecdsa at this time.\n\nCurrent releases of Red Hat Virtualization Manager no longer includes python-ecdsa as a dependency.  While it remains available in repositories as a legacy dependency, it is not installed by default and its use is not recommended.",
