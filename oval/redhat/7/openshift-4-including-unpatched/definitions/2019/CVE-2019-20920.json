    "Description": "STATEMENT: Red Hat Quay includes Handlebars.js as a development dependency. It does not use Handlebars.js at runtime to process templates so have been given a low impact rating.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization includes Handlebars.js in two components. In ovirt-engine-ui-extentions the version used is newer and not affected by this flaw. In ovirt-web-ui Handlebars.js is included as a development dependency and is not used at runtime to process templates so have been given a low impact rating.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 delivers the kibana package which includes Handlebars.js. From OCP 4.6, the kibana package is no longer shipped and will not be fixed. The openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6 container includes Handlebars.js directly as container first code. The vulnerable version of Handlebars.js is also included in openshift4/ose-grafana but as the Grafana instance is in read-only mode the configuration/dashboards cannot be modified.",
