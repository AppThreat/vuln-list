    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-set-value. The function mixin-deep can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype using any of the constructor, prototype, or _proto_ payloads. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n            STATEMENT: While OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) contains the affected nodejs-set-value code, it's added as a dependency of Kibana 5. Similar issue about prototype pollution [1] have been fixed, but no known attack vector was found, so we're rating this issue as Low for OCP. \n\nIn Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, nodejs-set-value is bundled into nodejs-nodemon, and is not meant to be accessed outside of that package. Within nodemon, this flaw is rated with a Low severity.\n\n[1] CVE-2019-10744 https://www.elastic.co/community/security",
