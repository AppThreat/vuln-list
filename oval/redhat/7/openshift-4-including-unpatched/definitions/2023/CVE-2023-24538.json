    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Golang Go. This flaw allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by not properly considering backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker execute arbitrary code on the system. \n            STATEMENT: The described issue involving Go templates and JavaScript template literals poses a moderate severity rather than an important one due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the vulnerability requires specific conditions to be met: the presence of Go templates within JavaScript template literals. This limits the scope of affected codebases, reducing the likelihood of exploitation. Additionally, the decision to disallow such interactions in future releases of Go indicates a proactive approach to addressing the issue. Furthermore, the affected packages or components within Red Hat Enterprise Linux, such as Conmon, Grafana, and the RHC package, have been assessed and determined not to be impacted due to their specific usage patterns. So the limited scope of affected systems and the absence of exploitation vectors in specific components within Red Hat Enterprise Linux contribute to categorizing the severity of the issue as moderate.\n\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n* Conmon uses go in unit testing, but not functionally in the package. Go is used only in test files, hence, not in the actual code, thus, conmon is not affected.\n* The Go templates in Grafana do not contain any javascript. Thus, it is not affected.\n* The rhc package do not make use of html/template. Hence, it is also not affected.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
