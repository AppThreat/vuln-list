    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was found in the go library go-git. This issue may allow an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server, which can trigger resource exhaustion in go-git clients. \n            STATEMENT: This problem only affects the go implementation and not the original git cli code. Applications using only in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue. Clients should be limited to connect to only trusted git servers to reduce the risk of compromise.\n            MITIGATION: In cases where a bump to the latest version of go-git is not possible, a recommendation to reduce the exposure of this threat is limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers.",
