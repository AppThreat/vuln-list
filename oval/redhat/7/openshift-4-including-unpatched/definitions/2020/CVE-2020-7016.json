    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Timelion, which is a kibana component. An attacker can construct a URL that when viewed by a Kibana user can lead to the Kibana process consuming large amounts of CPU and becoming unresponsive.\n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) the affected Kibana component is behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable Timelion Kibana component to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is Low.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 delivers Kibana package where the Timelion tool is used, but due to the code changing to the container first content the kibana package is marked as wontfix. This may be fixed in the future.",
