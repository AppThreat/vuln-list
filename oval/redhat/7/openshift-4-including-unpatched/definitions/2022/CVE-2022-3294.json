    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Kubernetes, where users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network. Kubernetes supports node proxying, which allows clients of kube-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in the kube-apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this validation allows authenticated requests destined for Nodes to redirect to the API Server through its private network. \n            STATEMENT: Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node objects and send requests proxying through them.\n\nThe \"openshift\" component of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 was fixed in RHBA-2023:0452 and as such is marked not affected.",
