    "Description": "Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.\n\nRed Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual environments. CloudForms Management Engine is built on Ruby on Rails, a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version:\nansible (2.3.0.0), ansible-tower (3.1.3), cfme (5.8.1.5), cfme-appliance\n(5.8.1.5), cfme-gemset (5.8.1.5), rh-ruby23-rubygem-nokogiri (1.7.2).\n(BZ#1456017, BZ#1459318)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* CloudForms lacks RBAC controls on certain methods in the rails application portion of CloudForms. An attacker with access could use a variety of methods within the rails applications portion of CloudForms to escalate privileges. (CVE-2017-2664)\n\n* It was found that privilege check is missing when invoking arbitrary methods via filtering on VMs that MiqExpression will execute that is triggerable by API users. An attacker could use this to execute actions they should not be allowed to (e.g. destroying VMs). (CVE-2017-7530)\n\n* The dialog for creating cloud volumes (cinder provider) in CloudForms does not filter cloud tenants by user. An attacker with the ability to create storage volumes could use this to create storage volumes for any other tenant. (CVE-2017-7497)\n\n* A flaw was found in the CloudForms API. A user with permissions to use the MiqReportResults capability within the API could potentially view data from other tenants or groups to which they should not have access. (CVE-2016-7047)\n\nThe CVE-2017-2664 issue was discovered by Libor Pichler (Red Hat) and Martin Povolny (Red Hat); the CVE-2017-7530 issue was discovered by Tim Wade (Red Hat); the CVE-2017-7497 issue was discovered by Gellert Kis (Red Hat); and the CVE-2016-7047 issue was discovered by Simon Lukasik (Red Hat).\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements. Documentation for these changes is available from the Release Notes document linked to in the References section.",
