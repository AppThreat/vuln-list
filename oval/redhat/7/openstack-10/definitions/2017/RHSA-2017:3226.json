    "Description": "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A permissions flaw was found in redis, which sets weak permissions on certain files and directories that could potentially contain sensitive information. A local, unprivileged user could possibly use this flaw to access unauthorized system information. (CVE-2016-2121)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Honza Horak (Red Hat) and Remi Collet (Red Hat).",
