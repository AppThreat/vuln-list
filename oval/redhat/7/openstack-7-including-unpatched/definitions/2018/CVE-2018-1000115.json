    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was discovered that the memcached connections using UDP transport protocol can be abused for efficient traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A remote attacker could send a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of a target system to memcached, causing it to send a significantly larger response to the target. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat is aware of traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that take advantage of the insecurely configured memcached servers reachable from the public Internet. The default configuration of memcached as shipped in Red Hat products makes it possible to abuse them for these DDoS attacks if memcached is exposed to connections from the public Internet. Refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article 3369081 for instructions on how to properly secure memcached installations to prevent them from being used in the attack.\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3369081\n            MITIGATION: Please refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article 3369081 for instructions on how to properly secure memcached installations to prevent them from being used in an attack.\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3369081",
