    "Description": "Libreswan is an implementation of IPsec \u0026 IKE for Linux. IPsec is the\nInternet Protocol Security and uses strong cryptography to provide both\nauthentication and encryption services. These services allow you to build\nsecure tunnels through untrusted networks such as virtual private network\n(VPN).\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way Libreswan's IKE daemon processed IKE KE\npayloads. A remote attacker could send specially crafted IKE payload with a\nKE payload of g^x=0 that, when processed, would lead to a denial of service\n(daemon crash). (CVE-2015-3240)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Paul Wouters of Red Hat.\n\nNote: Please note that when upgrading from an earlier version of Libreswan,\nthe existing CA certificates in the /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/ directory and the\nexisting certificate revocation list (CRL) files from the\n/etc/ipsec.d/crls/ directory are automatically imported into the NSS\ndatabase. Once completed, these directories are no longer used by\nLibreswan. To install new CA certificates or new CRLS, the certutil and\ncrlutil commands must be used to import these directly into the Network\nSecurity Services (NSS) database.\n\nThis update also adds the following enhancements:\n\n* This update adds support for RFC 7383 IKEv2 Fragmentation, RFC 7619 Auth\nNull and ID Null, INVALID_KE renegotiation, CRL and OCSP support via NSS,\nAES_CTR and AES_GCM support for IKEv2, CAVS testing for FIPS compliance.\n\nIn addition, this update enforces FIPS algorithms restrictions in FIPS\nmode, and runs Composite Application Validation System (CAVS) testing for\nFIPS compliance during package build. A new Cryptographic Algorithm\nValidation Program (CAVP) binary can be used to re-run the CAVS tests at\nany time. Regardless of FIPS mode, the pluto daemon runs RFC test vectors\nfor various algorithms.\n\nFurthermore, compiling on all architectures now enables the \"-Werror\" GCC\noption, which enhances the security by making all warnings into errors.\n(BZ#1263346)\n\n* This update also fixes several memory leaks and introduces a sub-second\npacket retransmit option. (BZ#1268773)\n\n* This update improves migration support from Openswan to Libreswan.\nSpecifically, all Openswan options that can take a time value without a\nsuffix are now supported, and several new keywords for use in the\n/etc/ipsec.conf file have been introduced. See the relevant man pages for\ndetails. (BZ#1268775)\n\n* With this update, loopback support via the \"loopback=\" option has been\ndeprecated. (BZ#1270673)\n\nAll Libreswan users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements.",
