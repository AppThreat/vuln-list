    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in https-proxy-agent, prior to version 2.2.0. It was discovered https-proxy-agent passes an auth option to the Buffer constructor without proper sanitization. This could result in a Denial of Service through the usage of all available CPU resources and data exposure through an uninitialized memory leak in setups where an attacker could submit typed input to the auth parameter.\n            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of nodejs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 as they already include the patched code.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of rh-nodejs10-nodejs as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections 3 as they already include the patched code.\n\nRed Hat Quay uses nodejs-https-proxy-agent, but only as a development dependency, it is not used at runtime. Therefore we rated this issue as having a low impact for Red Hat Quay.",
