    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind that could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. This issue extends the previous flaws CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-17485 by blacklisting more classes that could be used maliciously.\n            STATEMENT: JBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advice about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here: \n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231\n\nThis issue affects the versions of jackson-databind (in Satellite 6.0 and 6.1) and candlepin (which embeds a copy of jackson-databind in Satellite 6.2) as shipped with Red Hat Satellitw 6.x. However the affected code is NOT used at this time:\n\nCandlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited BZ 1462702 , candlepin should not be affected.\n\nHowever as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked.\n\nRed Hat Subscription Asset Manager version 1 is now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.",
