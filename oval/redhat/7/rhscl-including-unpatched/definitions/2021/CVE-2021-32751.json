    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Gradle, which allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system caused by a flaw in start and gradlew. By sending specially crafted environment variables, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system. \n            STATEMENT: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to set the value of particular environment variables and have those environment variables be seen by the vulnerable scripts. This requirement makes this CVE of a Moderate impact.\n            MITIGATION: CI/CD systems using the Gradle build tool\n- You are not vulnerable if untrusted users are unable to change environment variables for the user that executes gradlew.\n- If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.2, you can generate a new gradlew script with Gradle 7.2 and use it for older versions of Gradle.\n\nApplications using start scripts generated by Gradle\n- You are not vulnerable if untrusted users are unable to change environment variables for the user that executes the start script.\n- If you are unsure, the vulnerable start script could be manually patched to remove the use of eval or the use of environment variables that affect the application's command-line.\n- If the application is simple enough, you may be able to avoid the use of the start scripts by running the application directly with the Java command.",
