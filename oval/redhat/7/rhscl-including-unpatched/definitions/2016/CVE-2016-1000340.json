    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions 1.51 to 1.55, a carry propagation bug was introduced in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes have been fixed (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our custom elliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), so there was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been detected with high probability by the output validation for our scalar multipliers. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of bouncycastle as shipped with Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.x. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Low. No update is planned for this product at this time.
