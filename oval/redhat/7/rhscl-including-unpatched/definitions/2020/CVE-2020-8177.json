    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in curl. Overwriting local files is possible when using a certain combination of command line options. Requesting content from a malicious server could lead to overwriting local files with compromised files leading to unknown effects. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to file integrity. \n            STATEMENT: This issue only affects the 'curl' command line utility. Additionally, this is only an issue when using the '-J' (with the '-O' option) and '-i' command line options combined.\n\nIn most cases, there is nothing to gain for a local attacker here: the curl command line utility is likely running with the same privileges as the user, and thus the user can already overwrite all the files curl could overwrite. However, a local user will have to call curl with the '-J' and '-i' command line options while requesting content from a malicious server, which then opens up an opportunity for the malicious server to overwrite local files.\n            MITIGATION: The vulnerability is only possible when using the '-J' and '-i' switches in conjunction with the curl command.  Executing curl without these switches mitigates the flaw.",
