    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in FasterXML jackson-databind in versions 2.0.0 through 2.9.10.2. A \"gadget\" exploit is possible due to a lack of a Java object being blocking from being deserialized. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n\nWhile OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.",
