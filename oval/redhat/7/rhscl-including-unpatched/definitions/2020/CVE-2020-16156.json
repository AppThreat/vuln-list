    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the way the perl-CPAN performed verification of package signatures stored in CHECKSUMS files. A malicious or compromised CPAN server used by a user, or a man-in-the-middle attacker, could use this flaw to bypass signature verification. \n            \n            MITIGATION: This issue can be mitigated by configuring perl-CPAN to only use trusted CPAN mirrors (www.cpan.org or cpan.metacpan.org) and use HTTPS for communication with CPAN servers.  If you already have a cpan configured, the list of configured mirrors can be viewed by running the `cpan` command without any argument and entering the following command on the cpan command's prompt:\n\n```\n  o conf urllist\n```\n\nEnsure that the URL list only includes trusted mirrors and that https:// scheme is used for all URLs.  A different set of mirrors can be configured using the following commands (these examples show how to configure one or more mirrors, only one of the commands should be used):\n\n```\n  o conf urllist https://www.cpan.org\n  o conf urllist https://www.cpan.org https://cpan.metacpan.org\n```\n\nAfter changing configuration, the following command must be used to save the configuration:\n\n```\n  o conf commit\n```",
