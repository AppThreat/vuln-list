    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nIt was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a\nspecially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for\ncommunication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt\nand modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)\n\nNote: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be\nusing a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL\nversion 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of\nOpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter\nof this issue.\n\nAll OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take\neffect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other\nSSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.",
