    "Description": "The powerpc-utils packages provide various utilities for the PowerPC platform.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the snap utility of powerpc-utils generated an archive containing a configuration snapshot of a service. A local attacker could obtain sensitive information from the generated archive such as plain text passwords. (CVE-2014-4040)\n\nThe powerpc-utils packages have been upgraded to the upstream version 1.2.24, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1088539, BZ#1167865, BZ#1161552)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the lsdevinfo command did not correctly process the path to the device, which made the path unreadable in the console output of lsdevinfo. With this update, lsdevinfo has been updated and the path is now displayed correctly. (BZ#1079246)\n\n* Previously, after migrating several Linux partitions, Resource Monitoring and Control (RMC) was inactive and Machine Type, Model, and Serial number (MTMS) were set incorrectly, so the subsequent validation operation failed. This bug has been fixed, and validation is now successful after migration and suspend. (BZ#1083221)\n\n* Previously, when the drmgr tool attempted to remove the last CPU from the system, drmgr became unresponsive or terminated unexpectedly. This bug has been fixed, and drmgr no longer hangs or crashes in the described case. (BZ#1152313)\n\n* With this update, the drmgr utility has been fixed to correctly gather Logical Memory Block (LMB) information while performing Mem Dynamic Logical Partitioning (DLPAR) on little-endian varian of IBM Power Systems CPU architecture as expected (BZ#1170856).\n\n* Previously, the \"ppc64_cpu --threads-per-core\" command returned incorrect data with the --smt option enabled. This bug has been fixed and \"ppc64_cpu --threads-per-core\" now reports correctly with enabled --smt. (BZ#1179263)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* This update adds support for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux for POWER, little endian CPU architecture to the powerpc-utils package. (BZ#1124006)\n\n* This update adds support for hot plugging of the qemu virtio device with the drmgr command to the powerpc-utils package.(BZ#1083791)\n\n* The deprecated snap tool has been removed from the powerpc-utils packages. Its functionality has been integrated into the sosreport tool. (BZ#1172087)\n\n* With this update, a dependency on the perl-Data-Dumper package required by the rtas_dump utility has been added to powerpc-utils packages. (BZ#1175812) \n\nUsers of powerpc-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.",
