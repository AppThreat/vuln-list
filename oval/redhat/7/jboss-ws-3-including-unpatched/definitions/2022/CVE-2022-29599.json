    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the maven-shared-utils package. This issue allows a Command Injection due to improper escaping, allowing a shell injection attack. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite ships Candlepin component, which uses the Tomcatjss module from the RHEL AppStream repository. In turn, Tomcatjss relies on Maven, which itself depends on affected Apache Maven Shared Utils. Due to the fact that Satellite does not directly use Apache Maven Shared Utils, or expose it in its code, it is considered not affected by the flaw. Satellite customers can resolve the security warning by updating to the fixed Apache Maven Shared Utils through the updated Maven module, which is available in the RHEL 8 AppStream repository. It's worth noting that this solution applies solely to RHEL 8, which supports modules exclusively, and it is not applicable to earlier versions including RHEL 7.",
