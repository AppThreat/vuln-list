    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A verification flaw was found in python-pysaml2, where it did not validate signed SAML documents against an XML schema. Because the flaw allowed invalid XML documents to be processed, a network attacker could exploit this flaw by tricking pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. \n            STATEMENT: All versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform ship but do not use the flawed check-signature functionality of python-pysaml2. The impact for these products is therefore rated as having a security impact of Low and will not be updated at this time.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
