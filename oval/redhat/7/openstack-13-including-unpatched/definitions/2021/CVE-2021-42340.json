    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A memory leak flaw was found in Apache Tomcat, where an HTTP upgrade connection does not release for WebSocket connections once the WebSocket connection is closed. If a sufficient number of such requests are made, an OutOfMemoryError occurs, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Within Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Tomcat is provided as a component of OpenDaylight. This flaw will not receive a fix as OpenDaylight was deprecated as of OpenStack Platform 14 and is only receiving security fixes for Critical flaws.\n\nRed Hat Satellite does not include the affected Apache Tomcat, however, Tomcat is shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and consumed by the Candlepin component of Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are therefore advised to check the impact state of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, since any necessary fixes will be distributed through the platform.",
