    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Shiro. When using Apache Shiro with Spring, a specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality, integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Although Red Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight includes the affected code, the vulnerable function is not used, therefore, not exploitable. For this reason, the RHOSP impact is low, and no update will be provided at this time for OpenDaylight.",
