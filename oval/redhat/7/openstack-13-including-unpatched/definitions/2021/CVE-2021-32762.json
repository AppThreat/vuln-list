    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer overflow issue leading to heap buffer overflow was found in the `hiredis` library. The \"redis-cli\" command-line tool and \"redis-sentinel\" service may be vulnerable to this flaw when parsing specially crafted, large multi-bulk network replies. This flaw allows a remote attacker to corrupt the heap and potentially trigger remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: The following products are not affected by this flaw because they use `jemalloc` as default heap allocator:\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8\n* Red Hat Software Collections\n* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes",
