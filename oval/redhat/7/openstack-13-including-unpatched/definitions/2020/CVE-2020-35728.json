    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jackson-databind. FasterXML mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: The following Red Hat Products ship jackson-databind version 2.10.0 or later which is not considered affected by this CVE (see https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba) \n* JBoss Data Grid 7\n* JBoss Data Grid 8\n* Enterprise Application Platform 7\n* Red Hat Decision Manager 7\n* Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7\n* Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) 7\n* Red Hat JBoss Fuse 7\n* Red Hat JBoss A-MQ\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8\n* Red Hat Satellite 6.6\n* Red Hat Satellite 6.7\n* Red Hat Satellite 6.8\n* Red Hat CodeReady Studio 12\n\nRed Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Red Hat OpenStack Platform does ship the vulnerable components, but does not enable the unsafe conditions needed to exploit, lowering their vulnerability impact.\n\nIn Red Hat Openshift 4 there are no plans to maintain the ose-logging-elasticsearch5 container, hence it has been marked wontfix at this time and may be fixed in a future update.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform 13 ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind, but does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it exploitable. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n            MITIGATION: The following conditions are needed for an exploit, we recommend avoiding all if possible:\n* Deserialization from sources you do not control\n* `enableDefaultTyping()`\n* `@JsonTypeInfo using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS`\n* avoid com.oracle.wls.shaded.org.apache.xalan.lib.sql.JNDIConnectionPool in the classpath",
