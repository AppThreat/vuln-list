    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when a file is moved using atomic_move primitive as the file mode cannot be specified. This sets the destination files world-readable if the destination file does not exist and if the file exists, the file could be changed to have less restrictive permissions before the move.  This issue affects only the newly created files and not existing ones. If the file already exists at the final destination, those permissions are retained. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data. \n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.8.14 and 2.9.12 as well as previous versions and all 2.7.x versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.6.5 and 3.7.2 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.\n            MITIGATION: This issue can be mitigated by specifying the \"mode\" on the task. That just leaves a race condition in place where newly created files that specify a mode in the task briefly go from 666 - umask to the final mode. An alternative workaround if many new files are created and to avoid setting a specific mode for each file would be to set the \"mode\" to \"preserve\" value. That will maintain the permissions of the source file on the controller in the final file on the managed host.",
