A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read web application files from a vulnerable server. In instances where the vulnerable server allows file uploads, an attacker could upload malicious JavaServer Pages (JSP) code within a variety of file types and trigger this vulnerability to gain remote code execution (RCE). \n            STATEMENT: Please refer to the Red Hat knowledgebase article: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4851251 and CVE page https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-1745\n            MITIGATION: Please refer to the Red Hat knowledgebase article: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4851251",
