    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Shiro in versions prior to 1.5.3. When using Apache Shiro with Spring dynamic controllers, a specially crafted request may cause an authentication bypass. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Whilst the OpenDaylight version that is included in Red Hat OpenStack Platform includes the affected code, the vulnerable functionality is not used and therefore not exploitable.",
