    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Spring Framework, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7 and 4.3.x prior to 4.3.18 and older unsupported versions, allows web applications to enable cross-domain requests via JSONP (JSON with Padding) through AbstractJsonpResponseBodyAdvice for REST controllers and MappingJackson2JsonView for browser requests. Both are not enabled by default in Spring Framework nor Spring Boot, however, when MappingJackson2JsonView is configured in an application, JSONP support is automatically ready to use through the \"jsonp\" and \"callback\" JSONP parameters, enabling cross-domain requests. \n            STATEMENT: From an OpenDaylight perspective, whilst the shipped versions of Open Dayight ship artifacts which fall within the affected versions (\"older unsupported versions\"), this flaw only has impact when JSONP is used in certain circumstances. Given the libraries themselves are not used in a vulnerable way, being only used as part of tests, no package update to mitigate this flaw for Open Daylight is required.\n\nThe package rhevm-dependencies does not include the spring-webmvc component, where this vulnerability exists.\n            MITIGATION: According to the upstream advisory, this vulnerability only applies to applications that do all of the following:\n\n * Explicitly configure MappingJackson2JsonView.\n * Do not set the jsonpParameterNames property of MappingJackson2JsonView to an empty set.\n * Expose sensitive user information over endpoints that can render content with JSONP.",
