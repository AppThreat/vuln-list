    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: The documentation of Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M14, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.20, 9.0.13 to 9.0.62 and 8.5.38 to 8.5.78 for the EncryptInterceptor incorrectly stated it enabled Tomcat clustering to run over an untrusted network. This was not correct. While the EncryptInterceptor does provide confidentiality and integrity protection, it does not protect against all risks associated with running over any untrusted network, particularly DoS risks. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw describes a mistake made in the documentation which overstated the protection provided by the clustering feature. As the impact is Low and a patch would not directly improve the security posture of Apache Tomcat, this flaw is marked as will not fix for all Red Hat products. This may be fixed in a future release.\n            MITIGATION: For customers who use clustering on an untrusted network and require full protection, an alternate solution is recommended such as using a VPN.",
