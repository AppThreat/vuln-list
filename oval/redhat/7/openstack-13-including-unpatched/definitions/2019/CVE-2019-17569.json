    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw did not affect the versions of Tomcat as shipped with Red Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and 8, as they did not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a later version of the package.\n\nOpenDaylight in Red Hat OpenStack 10 \u0026 13 was in technical preview status, because of this no fixes will be released for it.",
