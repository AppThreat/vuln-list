    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, an xsl:number with certain format strings could lead to a uninitialized read in xsltNumberFormatInsertNumbers. This could allow an attacker to discern whether a byte on the stack contains the characters A, a, I, i, or 0, or any other character. \n            STATEMENT: * This issue affects the versions of libxslt as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and 8. It has been classified with the security impact of 'Low' by the Red Hat Product Security Team.\n* This issue affects the version of libxslt as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, as it includes the affected code which allows uninitialized read.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform versions 9, 10, 13, \u0026 14 are marked WONTFIX as they will inherit fixes from the underlying RHEL layer.",
