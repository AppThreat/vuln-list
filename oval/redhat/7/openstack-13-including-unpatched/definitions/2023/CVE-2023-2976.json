    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Guava. The methodology for temporary directories and files can allow other local users or apps with accordant permissions to access the temp files, possibly leading to information exposure or tampering in the files created in the directory. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Single Sign-On 7 ships the affected component as a layered product of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application 7, and as such is affected by this flaw. However, Single Sign-On 7 does not use the affected code and is not vulnerable to exploit.\n            MITIGATION: Temp files should be created with sufficiently non-predictable names and in a secure-permissioned, dedicated temp folder.",
