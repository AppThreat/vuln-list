    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors may allow information disclosure. This issue could allow a privileged user to enable information disclosure via local access. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat has very limited visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content. In most cases, it merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers, with no possibility of influencing or documenting the changes. Unless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required for releasing this content as a RHSA, in terms of Red Hat-owned development processes and QA documentation. For more information, please contact the binary content vendor.",
