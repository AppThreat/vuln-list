    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A regular expression denial of service vulnerability was found in hosted-git-info. If an application allows user input into the affected regular expression (regexp) function, `shortcutMatch` or `fromUrl`, then an attacker could craft a regexp which takes an ever increasing amount of time to process, potentially resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: While some components do package a vulnerable version of hosted-git-info, access to them requires OpenShift OAuth credentials and hence have been marked with a Low impact. This applies to the following products:\n  - OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)\n  - OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM)\n  - Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM)\n\nSpecifically the following components:\n - The OCP hive-container does ship the vulnerable component, however since OCP 4.6 the Metering product has been deprecated [1], set as wont-fix and may be fixed in a future release.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 4 packages a version of nodejs-hosted-git-info which is vulnerable to this flaw in the grafana-container shipped with it. \n\nRed Hat Quay includes hosted-git-info as a dependency of karma-coverage which is only used at development time. The hosted-git-info library is not used at runtime so the impact is low for Red Hat Quay.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization includes a vulnerable version of hosted-git-info, however it is only used during development. The hosted-git-info library is not used at runtime thus impact is rated Low and marked as \"wontfix\" at this time. Future updates may address this flaw.\n\n[1] - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5707561",
