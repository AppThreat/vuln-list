    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: ** DISPUTED **   An issue was discovered in NumPy 1.16.0 and earlier. It uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is  a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example)  loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated  sources. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Management Appliance includes the vulnerable version of numpy, however it is not used and this vulnerability is not exposed.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform includes a vulnerable version of numpy, however it is not used in a vulnerable manner.",
