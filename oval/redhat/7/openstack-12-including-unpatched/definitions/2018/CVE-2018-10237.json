    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Guava where the AtomicDoubleArray and CompoundOrdering classes were found to allocate memory based on size fields sent by the client without validation. A crafted message could cause the server to consume all available memory or crash leading to a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes: Eclipse Vert.x is not exploitable by this flaw, though the vulnerable code is a transient dependency to the product. This issue may be addressed in a future release.",
