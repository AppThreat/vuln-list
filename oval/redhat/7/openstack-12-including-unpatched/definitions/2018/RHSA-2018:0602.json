    "Description": "openstack-tripleo-common contains the python library for code common to the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director CLI and GUI (codename tripleo).\n\nopenstack-tripleo-heat-templates is a collection of OpenStack Orchestration templates and tools (codename heat), which can be used to help deploy OpenStack.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* openstack-tripleo-heat-templates: Ceph client keyring is world-readable when deployed by director (CVE-2017-12155)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Katuya Kawakami (NEC) for reporting this issue.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* All Compute and Controller nodes have bridge-mappings configured and therefore are eligible to schedule routers. However, if you scheduled a router on a Compute node that doesn't have a connection to an external network, connectivity with the external network fails. This fix adds the ability to configure bridge-mappings in TripleO and in the director according to roles so that you can now exclude Compute nodes from router scheduling and maintain external network connectivity. (BZ#1510879)\n\n* Previously, the CephPools parameter value was incorrectly consumed as a string list instead of as a JSON object. This prevented creating additional Ceph pools during the overcloud deployment, because attempting to pass a JSON object failed. This fix updates the CephPools parameter so that it now accepts any JSON object that describes additional pools to create in the Ceph cluster. Note: The JSON object structure must conform to ceph-ansible conventions. (BZ#1516389)\n\n* There is currently a known issue with LDAP integration for Red Hat OpenStack Platform. The `keystone_domain_confg` tag is missing currently from `keystone.yaml`, preventing Puppet from properly applying the required configuration files. Consequently, LDAP integration with Red Hat OpenStack Platform will not be properly configured. As a workaround, you must manually edit `keystone.yaml` and add the missing tag. There are two ways to do this:\n\n1. Edit the file directly:\n  a. Log into the undercloud as the stack user.\n  b. Open the keystone.yaml in the editor of your choice. For example:\n       `sudo vi /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/services/keystone.yaml`\n  c. Append the missing puppet tag, `keystone_domain_confg`, to line 94. For example:\n      `puppet_tags: keystone_config`\n        Changes to:\n      `puppet_tags: keystone_config,keystone_domain_confg`\n  d. Save and close `keystone.yaml`.\n  e. Verify you see the missing tag in the `keystone.yaml` file. The following command should return '1':\n    `cat /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/sercies/keystone.yaml | grep 'puppet_tags: keystone_config,keystone_domain_config' | wc -l`\n\n2. Or, use sed to edit the file inline:\n  a. Login to the undercloud as the stack user.\n  b. Run the following command to add the missing puppet tag:\n     `sed -i 's/puppet_tags\\: keystone_config/puppet_tags\\: keystone_config,keystone_domain_config/' /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/services/keystone.yaml`\n  c. Verify you see the missing tag in the keystone.yaml file The following command should return '1':\n    `cat /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/sercies/keystone.yaml | grep 'puppet_tags: keystone_config,keystone_domain_config' | wc -l` (BZ#1519057)\n\n* It is only possible to deploy Ceph storage servers if their disk devices are homogeneous.
