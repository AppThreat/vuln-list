    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Escape sequence injection vulnerability in Fluentd versions 0.12.29 through 0.12.40 may allow an attacker to change the terminal UI or execute arbitrary commands on the device via unspecified vectors. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw requires particular preconditions to be exploitable, which are not common in supported deployments of fluentd. The vulnerable system must have all of:\n\n1. A filter_parser enabled in fluentd.conf\n\n2. Fluentd running in non-daemon mode or a bad syslog server that doesn't sanitise escape sequences (rsyslog does)\n\n3. A vulnerable terminal that happens to be running fluentd or manipulating the fluentd log file (for example tailing it)\n\nThis issue affects the versions of fluentd as shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue.
