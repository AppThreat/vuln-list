    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An uncontrolled resource consumption flaw as found in python-httplib2, due to a flawed regular expression used while parsing the WWW-Authenticate header in an HTTP response. This flaw allows a malicious or compromised server to reply with a crafted sequence of characters in the WWW-Authenticate header, leading to a denial of service of the httplib2 client accessing the server. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low, because it requires a malicious or compromised server in order to be exploited, and it only affects the HTTP client. In Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP 13 python-httplib2 package.\n            MITIGATION: Use strict mode to parse WWW-Authenticate headers. This can be done by setting `httplib2.USE_WWW_AUTH_STRICT_PARSING = True`. Please note, however, that strict mode might lead to bad results in case of ill-formed header values.",
