    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Salt, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when processing unauthenticated requests by the ClearFuncs class. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on Salt minions as root.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 shipped salt for the usage of Red Hat Storage Console 2(RHSCON-2), which required salt to administrate ceph nodes. RHSCON-2 has reached End Of Life, hence salt is no longer used and supported. Therefore, the salt package provided by Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 has been marked as 'will not fix'.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update as soon as possible.",
