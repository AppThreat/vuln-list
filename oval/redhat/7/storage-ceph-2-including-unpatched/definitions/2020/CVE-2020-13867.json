    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An access flaw was found in targetcli, where the `/etc/target` and underneath backup directory/files were world-readable. This flaw allows a local attacker to access potentially sensitive information such as authentication credentials from the /etc/target/saveconfig.json and backup files. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: The version of targetcli shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 sets the world-readable permissions for `/etc/target` and `/etc/target/backup` directory that store the sensitive information, hence affected by this vulnerability.\n            MITIGATION: $ chmod -R og-rwx /etc/target\n\nFuture backup files will still be created with incorrect permissions, but attackers will not be able to access the target directory.",
