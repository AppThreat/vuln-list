    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the pipe lookup plugin of ansible. Arbitrary commands can be run, when the pipe lookup plugin uses subprocess.Popen() with shell=True, by overwriting ansible facts and the variable is not escaped by quote plugin. An attacker could take advantage and run arbitrary commands by overwriting the ansible facts.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.16, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.\n            MITIGATION: This issue can be avoided by escaping variables which are used in the lookup.",
