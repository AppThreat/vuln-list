    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the x86 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is prone to\na denial of service attack inside a virtualized environment in the form of\nan infinite loop in the microcode due to the way (sequential) delivering of\nbenign exceptions such as #DB (debug exception) is handled. A privileged\nuser inside a guest could use this flaw to create denial of service\nconditions on the host kernel. (CVE-2015-8104, Important)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's key\nmanagement subsystem handled keyring object reference counting in certain\nerror path of the join_session_keyring() function. A local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.\n(CVE-2016-0728, Important)\n\n* It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 incorrectly kept buffer\noffset and buffer length in sync on a failed atomic read, potentially\nresulting in a pipe buffer state corruption. A local, unprivileged user\ncould use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user\nspace. (CVE-2016-0774, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Perception Point research team for\nreporting the CVE-2016-0728 issue. The security impact of the CVE-2016-0774\nissue was discovered by Red Hat.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* NMI watchdog of guests using legacy LVT0-based NMI delivery did not work\nwith APICv. Now, NMI works with LVT0 regardless of APICv. (BZ#1244726)\n\n* Parallel file-extending direct I/O writes could previously race to update\nthe size of the file. If they executed out-of-order, the file size could\nmove backwards and push a previously completed write beyond the end of the\nfile, causing it to be lost. (BZ#1258942)\n\n* The GHES NMI handler had a global spin lock that significantly increased\nthe latency of each perf sample collection. This update simplifies locking\ninside the handler. (BZ#1280200)\n\n* Sometimes, iptables rules are updated along with ip rules, and routes are\nreloaded. Previously, skb-\u003esk was mistakenly attached to some IPv6\nforwarding traffic packets, which could cause kernel panic. Now, such\npackets are checked and not processed. (BZ#1281700)\n\n* The NUMA node was not reported for PCI adapters, which affected every\nPOWER system deployed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and caused\nsignificant decrease in the system performance. (BZ#1283525)\n\n* Processing packets with a lot of different IPv6 source addresses caused\nthe kernel to return warnings concerning soft-lockups due to high lock\ncontention and latency increase. (BZ#1285369)\n\n* Running edge triggered interrupts with an ack notifier when\nsimultaneously reconfiguring the Intel I/O IOAPIC did not work correctly,\nso EOI in the interrupt did not cause a VM to exit if APICv was enabled.\nConsequently, the VM sometimes became unresponsive. (BZ#1287001)\n\n* Block device readahead was artificially limited, so the read performance\nwas poor, especially on RAID devices. Now, per-device readahead limits are\nused for each device, which has improved read performance. (BZ#1287548)\n\n* Identical expectations could not be tracked simultaneously even if they\nresided in different connection tracking zones. Now, an expectation insert\nattempt is rejected only if the zone is also identical. (BZ#1290093)\n\n* The storvsc kernel driver for Microsoft Hyper-V storage was setting\nincorrect SRB flags, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 guests running on\nMicrosoft Hyper-V were experiencing slow I/O as well as I/O failures when\nthey were connected to a virtual SAN. Now, SRB flags are set correctly.\n(BZ#1290095)\n\n* When a NUMA system with no memory in node 0 was used, the system\nterminated unexpectedly during boot or when using OpenVSwitch. Now, the\nkernel tries to allocate memory from other nodes when node 0 is not\npresent. (BZ#1300950)\n\nEnhancement:\n\n* IPsec has been updated to provide many fixes and some enhancements.\nOf particular note is the ability to match on outgoing interfaces.\n(BZ#1287407)",
