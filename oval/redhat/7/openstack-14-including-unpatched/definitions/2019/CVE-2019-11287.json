    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A resource-consumption flaw was identified in the rabbitmq-server web management plugin. Utilizing a malicious 'X-Reason' HTTP header, a remote attacker could insert a malicious Erlang format string which will expand and consume heap memory, resulting in a crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Ansible Tower and Red Hat CloudForms are not vulnerable as they do not expose the RabbitMQ management interface by default. \nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, the management interface was not enabled by default. So, although the flaw code was packaged, its impact for this version has been lowered to Moderate.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw can be mitigated by disabling the Web Management plugin: rabbitmq-plugins disable rabbitmq_management.",
