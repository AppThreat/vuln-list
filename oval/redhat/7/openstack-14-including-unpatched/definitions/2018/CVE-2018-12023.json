    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was discovered in jackson-databind where it would permit deserialization of a malicious object using Oracle JDBC classes when using DefaultTyping. An attacker could use this flaw to achieve remote code execution under certain circumstances. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since Candlepin's java runtime environment does not load Oracle's JDBC classes.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization 4 is not affected by this issue, since it does not load Oracle's JDBC classes.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.",
