    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in QEMU in the implementation of the Pointer Authentication (PAuth) support for ARM. A general failure of the signature generation process caused every PAuth-enforced pointer to be signed with the same signature. A local attacker could obtain the signature of a protected pointer and abuse this flaw to bypass PAuth protection for all programs running on QEMU. \n            STATEMENT: Several packages are unaffected because they do not include support for Pointer Authentication. These include:\n* `qemu-kvm-ma` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux for ARM 64 7\n* `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and 8\n* `qemu-kvm-rhev` as shipped with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 and 13",
