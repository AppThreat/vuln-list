    "Description": "The cpio packages provide the GNU cpio utility for creating and extracting\narchives, or copying files from one place to another.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in cpio's list_file() function.\nAn attacker could provide a specially crafted archive that, when processed\nby cpio, would crash cpio, or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n(CVE-2014-9112)\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, during archive creation, cpio internals did not detect a\nread() system call failure. Based on the premise that the call succeeded,\ncpio terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault without processing\nfurther files. The underlying source code has been patched, and an archive\nis now created successfully. (BZ#1138148)\n\n* Previously, running the cpio command without parameters on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 7 with Russian as the default language resulted in an\nerror message that was not accurate in Russian due to an error in spelling.\nThis has been corrected and the Russian error message is spelled correctly.\n(BZ#1075513)\n\nAll cpio users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
