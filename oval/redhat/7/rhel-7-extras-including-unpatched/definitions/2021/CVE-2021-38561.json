    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in golang. The language package for go language can panic due to an out-of-bounds read when an incorrectly formatted language tag is being parsed. This flaw allows an attacker to cause applications using this package to parse untrusted input data to crash, leading to a denial of service of the affected component. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw may be triggered only by accepting untrusted user input to the vulnerable golang's library. The overall DoS attack vector depends directly on how the library's input is exposed by the consuming application, thus Red Hat rates impact as Moderate.\n\nIn Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) 2.5 version, the registration-operator, lighthouse-coredns, lighthouse-agent, gatekeeper-operator, and discovery-operator components are affected by this flaw, but the rest of the components are using an already patched version and are unaffected. For 2.4 and previous versions of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM), most of the components are affected.",
