    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-jinja2. The ReDOS vulnerability of the regex is mainly due to the sub-pattern [a-zA-Z0-9._-]+.[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+. This issue can be mitigated by Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts and limiting process memory. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is out of support scope for the following products:\n\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7\n* Red Hat Ceph Storage 2\n\nTo learn more about Red Hat Enterprise Linux support scopes, please see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because python-jinja2 is not directly customer exposed, the Impact has been moved to Low and no updated will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-jinja2 package.\n\nRed Hat Quay does not make use of the vulnerable function, so the impact is Low.\n            MITIGATION: If using the jinja2 library as a developer, this flaw can be mitigated by not using the vulnerable urlize() filter, and instead, using Markdown to format user content.",
