    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in libssh. By utilizing the ProxyCommand or ProxyJump feature, users can exploit unchecked hostname syntax on the client. This issue may allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the command of the features mentioned through the hostname parameter. \n            STATEMENT: Despite the potential severity of this issue, the requirement for user interaction to exploit the vulnerability has led to a low severity rating. As a precautionary measure, users are advised to sanitize hostname inputs as a mitigation strategy.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
