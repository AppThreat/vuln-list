    "Description": "Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that runs virtually anywhere.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* docker: container breakout without selinux in enforcing mode (CVE-2018-10892)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nThis issue was discovered by Antonio Murdaca (Red Hat).\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, the `dontaudit` and `allow` SELinux rules were missing, so the kernel raised a SELinux AVC message. Consequently, some commands did not work as expected. This update adds the missing rules, and the commands now run successfully. (BZ#1550967)\n\n* Previously, during a restart the container daemon did not restore the state of a container correctly if an exec'ed process was associated with the container. Consequently, the container daemon aborted with 'panic: close of nil channel' when the daemon was handling the termination of the exec'ed process. This bug has been fixed, and the container daemon no longer panics in the aforementioned scenario. (BZ#1554121)\n\n* Previously, bind mounts were resolved before using them inside a container. Consequently, symlinks could not be mounted inside of the container. With this update, the source of a bind mount is not resolved. As a result, it is possible to bind mount symlinks again into a container. (BZ#1603201)",
