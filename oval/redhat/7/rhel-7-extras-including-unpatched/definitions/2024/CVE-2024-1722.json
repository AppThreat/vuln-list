    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: No description is available for this CVE. \n            STATEMENT: While this attack enables locking out an individual from their account, the entire system remains in operation. There are also several preconditions:\n* Realm is configured to use \"User (Self) registration\"\n* User registers with a username which is in email format\n* Attacker discovers a valid email address for an account\n\nTherefore the security impact has been rated Low.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat Product Security is not aware of a way to completely mitigate this issue. There are however some techniques which can be used to help prevent exploitation:\n* Put limits on frequency of account registration, restricting how often an attacker could utilize this attack \n* Restrict new account registration to not allow email address to be put into the username field, for example by not allowing the at symbol \"@\". However this cannot prevent attacks against existing users who registered with an email address.",
