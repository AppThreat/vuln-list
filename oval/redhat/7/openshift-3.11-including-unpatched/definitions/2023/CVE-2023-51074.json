    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A stack overflow vulnerability was found in the Criteria.parse() method in json-path. This issue occurs due to an uncontrolled recursion caused by specially crafted input, leading to a stack overflow. This vulnerability has the potential to trigger a crash, resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this at maximum of a Moderate impact. When interacting with a server to explore this possible vulnerability, the attacker would be the only one seeing a HTTP 500 error and no other user (or the server entirely) would be vulnerable in a real application scenario with multi-threads.",
