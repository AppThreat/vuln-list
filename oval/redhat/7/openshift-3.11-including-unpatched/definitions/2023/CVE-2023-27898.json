    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jenkins. Affected versions of Jenkins do not escape the Jenkins version that a plugin depends on when rendering the error message stating its incompatibility with the current version of Jenkins in the plugin manager. This issue results in a stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, exploitable by attackers able to provide plugins to the configured update sites and have this message shown by Jenkins instances. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift 3.11 is already in the ELS support model phase. The Jenkins components are out of the scope of the ELS support; hence OpenShift 3.11 Jenkins component is marked in this CVE as Out of Support Scope.",
