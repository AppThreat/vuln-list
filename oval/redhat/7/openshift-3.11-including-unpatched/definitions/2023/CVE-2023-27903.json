    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jenkins. When triggering a build from the Jenkins CLI, Jenkins creates a temporary file on the controller if a file parameter is provided through the CLIâ€™s standard input. Affected versions of Jenkins create this temporary file in the default temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files. If these permissions are overly permissive, they may allow attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is used in the build. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift 3.11 is already in the ELS support model phase. The Jenkins components are out of the scope of the ELS support; hence OpenShift 3.11 Jenkins component is marked in this CVE as Out of Support Scope.",
