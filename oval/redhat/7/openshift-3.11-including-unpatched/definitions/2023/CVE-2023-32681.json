    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Python-requests package, where it is vulnerable to potentially leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how rebuild_proxies is used to recompute and reattach the Proxy-Authorization header to requests when redirected. This behavior only affects proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (for example, https://username:password@proxy:8080). \n            \n            MITIGATION: For users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting allow_redirects to False on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you are currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)",
