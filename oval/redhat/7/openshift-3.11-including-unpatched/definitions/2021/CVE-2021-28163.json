    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: If the ${jetty.base} directory or the ${jetty.base}/webapps directory is a symlink the contents of the ${jetty.base}/webapps directory may be deployed as a static web application, exposing the content of the directory for download. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the hive/presto/hadoop components that comprise the OCP metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of jetty.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight will not be updated for this flaw because it was deprecated as of OpenStack Platform 14 and is only receiving security fixes for Important and Critical flaws.\n\nRed Hat CodeReady Studio 12 is not affected by this vulnerability because it does not ship a vulnerable version of jetty.",
