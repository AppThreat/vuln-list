    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content. In the OCI Image Specification, the manifest and index documents were not self-describing and documents with a single digest could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index. In the OCI Image Specification version 1.0.1 there is specified a recommendation that both manifest and index documents contain a `mediaType` field to identify the type of document. \n            STATEMENT: As a consequence of the OCI Image Specification (and OCI Distribution Specification [1]), container runtime engines (like containerd, moby - Docker Engine, cri-o) deliver updates to adopt new `mediaType` field used for identification of the document type. Even though some Red Hat products rely on container engine, the impact by this issue is LOW.\n\n[1] https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/security/advisories/GHSA-mc8v-mgrf-8f4m",
