    "Description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nAn invalid pointer use flaw was found in OpenSSL's ASN1_TYPE_cmp()\nfunction. A remote attacker could crash a TLS/SSL client or server using\nOpenSSL via a specially crafted X.509 certificate when the\nattacker-supplied certificate was verified by the application.\n(CVE-2015-0286)\n\nAn integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the\nway OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded inputs. An attacker able to\nmake an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded\ninput (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to\ncrash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because\nthe data being transferred is not Base64-encoded. (CVE-2015-0292)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2\nhandshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\nTLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both\nthe SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)\n\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL imported malformed\nElliptic Curve private keys. A specially crafted key file could cause an\napplication using OpenSSL to crash when imported. (CVE-2015-0209)\n\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way OpenSSL reused certain\nASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use a specially crafted\nASN.1 structure that, when parsed by an application, would cause that\napplication to crash. (CVE-2015-0287)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenSSL's X.509 certificate\nhandling implementation. A specially crafted X.509 certificate could cause\nan application using OpenSSL to crash if the application attempted to\nconvert the certificate to a certificate request. (CVE-2015-0288)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain\nPKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL\nverify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that\napplication to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not\naffected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0289)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting\nCVE-2015-0286, CVE-2015-0287, CVE-2015-0288, CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0292,\nand CVE-2015-0293. Upstream acknowledges Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL\ndevelopment team as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0286, Emilia Käsper\nof the OpenSSL development team as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0287,\nBrian Carpenter as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0288, Michal Zalewski\nof Google as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0289, Robert Dugal and David\nRamos as the original reporters of CVE-2015-0292, and Sean Burford of\nGoogle and Emilia Käsper of the OpenSSL development team as the original\nreporters of CVE-2015-0293.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* When a wrapped Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key did not require any\npadding, it was incorrectly padded with 8 bytes, which could lead to data\ncorruption and interoperability problems. With this update, the rounding\nalgorithm in the RFC 5649 key wrapping implementation has been fixed. As a\nresult, the wrapped key conforms to the specification, which prevents the\ndescribed problems. (BZ#1197667)\n\nAll openssl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take\neffect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or\nthe system rebooted.",
