    "Description": "The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages include the LDAP server and command-line utilities for server administration. \n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the code of search requests for asynchronous simple paged\nresults was not thread-safe, which created a small window during which a conflict could occur in the simple paged result slot. As a consequence, the server could terminate unexpectedly. To fix this bug, the code is now thread-safe, and the crash no longer occurs in this situation. \nIn addition, abandoning simple paged results request was previously not handled correctly if an abandon request was issued too quickly. Consequently, an internal search result object was in some cases not released. With this update, the search result request is safely released regardless of the timing of the abandon request. (BZ#1230037)\n\n* Prior to this update, a helper function to check whether the cache size is valid or not was resetting the cash size to a very small value. Consequently, the helper function was applied and the Distinguished Name (DN) cache was applied at the server start-up timing, which reduced the cache size. With this update, the helper function provides only the validity check and no longer resets the cache size. As a result, the entry and DN cache sizes do not get affected by the helper function. (BZ#1230038)\n\n* Previously, when AD users had multiple spaces inside the value of the RDN attribute, synchronizing the entry to the Directory Server failed. The underlying source code has been fixed, and Windows Synchronization (WinSync) plug-in in the Directory Server now works as expected. (BZ#1243718) \n\nUsers of 389-ds-base are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs. After installing this update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically.",
