    "Description": "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing\nKubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private\ncloud deployments.\n\nThis advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container\nPlatform 3.11.161. See the following advisory for the container images for\nthis release:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0018\n\nThis release fixes the following bugs:\n\n* In the openshift-logging update using Ansible, if a new value was set in the inventory file to apply the change to the existing cluster, the change was ignored. This occurred because the module logging_patch accidentally created a patch to change a new file into the original file. The patching direction was fixed and the changes made in an inventory file are now correctly applied. (BZ#1753593)\n\n* When the SDN pod was restarted on a node, it did not clean up any old Egress IP addresses. If the set of Egress IP addresses assigned to a node changed while the SDN pod was not running, then the node might continue to claim that it owned the Egress IP even after the IP had been assigned to another node. This caused traffic to that IP to be delivered to the wrong node and be lost. The SDN pod now cleans up stale Egress IP addresses at startup. (BZ#1762235)\n\n* SDN code would declare each node as READY before the SDN proxy was completely initialized. Some iptables rules would not be populated and the node is marked as ready. This caused some pods to not be able to communicate with the API while coming up. Now, all iptables rules exist before pods get schedules to the node, preventing issues where pod's cannot communicate with the API server. (BZ#1764150)\n\nThis release includes the following enhancements: \n\n* The latest Kuryr images are now hosted in Red Hat's registry. (BZ#1652571)\n\nAll OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 users are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages and images.",
