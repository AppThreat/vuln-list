    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in OpenSSL. This security issue occurs because the applications that use the DH_check(), DH_check_ex(), or EVP_PKEY_param_check() functions to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source may lead to a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in OpenSSL is considered low severity primarily because it requires specific conditions to be exploited and has limited impact. While excessive computation time during DH parameter checks could potentially lead to denial of service (DoS) attacks, the likelihood of successful exploitation is relatively low. Additionally, the vulnerability mainly affects applications that use certain OpenSSL functions for DH parameter validation, rather than the broader SSL/TLS implementation.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
