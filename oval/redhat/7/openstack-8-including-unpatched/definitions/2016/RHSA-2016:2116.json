    "Description": "OpenStack's File Share Service (manila) provides the means to easily provision shared file systems that can be consumed by multiple instances. These shared file systems are provisioned from pre-existing, back-end volumes. The UI component provides the dashboard plugin for the service.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A cross-site scripting flaw was discovered in openstack-manila-ui's Metadata field contained in its \"Create Share\" form. A user could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code that would then be reflected in the \"Shares\" overview. Remote, authenticated, but unprivileged users could exploit this vulnerability to steal session cookies and escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-6519)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank SUSE for reporting this issue. SUSE acknowledges Niklaus Schiess as the original reporter.",
