    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A cryptographic weakness was discovered in qpid-proton's use of TLS. If the qpid-proton client was used without client certificates, it would accept an anonymous cipher offered by the server. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to silently intercept traffic that should have been encrypted. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14 (and its Operational Tools) is impacted by this flaw; other supported versions are not vulnerable.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization 4 uses qpid-proton for katello-agent, which always uses client certificate authentication.\n\nRed Hat Update Infrastructure 3 is impacted by this flaw, however in its default configuration client certificate authentication is used and qpidd service, which uses qpid-proton, cannot be reach from other machines.\n            MITIGATION: This attack will not work if client-certificate authentication is in place because anonymous ciphers would not then be available.\nAnother possible mitigation is to disable anonymous ciphers on clients.",
