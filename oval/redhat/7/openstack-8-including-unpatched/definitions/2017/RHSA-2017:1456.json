    "Description": "OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking. The service can be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and applications. Additionally, Orchestration can be integrated with Telemetry alarms to implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-heat (5.0.3). (BZ#1409638)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An information-leak vulnerability was found in the OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service. Launching a new stack with a local URL resulted in a detailed error message, allowing an authenticated user to conduct network discovery and reveal the details of internal network services. (CVE-2016-9185)\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, when heat-engine was terminated during startup, it tried to clean up processes that had not been started. Consequently, heat-engine reported and logged the \"NoneType\" attribute error. This behaviour has been corrected, and heat-engine now shuts down gracefully. (BZ#1389972)",
