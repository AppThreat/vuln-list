    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in jackson-databind, where it would permit polymorphic deserialization of a malicious object using slf4j classes. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.\n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in jackson-databind involves exploiting CVE-2018-1088 against slf4j, which was fixed in Red Hat products through the errata referenced at https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-8088. Applications that link only slf4j versions including that fix are not vulnerable to this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since its candlepin component doesn't bundle slf4j-ext jar.",
