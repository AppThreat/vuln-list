    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Java logging library Apache Log4j in version 1.x. JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to SQL injection in untrusted data. This allows a remote attacker to run SQL statements in the database if the deployed application is configured to use JDBCAppender with certain interpolation tokens. \n            STATEMENT: Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default.\n\nRed Hat Satellite bundles log4j-over-slf4j with Candlepin, however, product is not affected as it uses logback framework for logging.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization and OpenShift Container Platform in the OCP Metering stack (the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components) ship a vulnerable version of the log4j package, however JDBCAppender is not used. Therefore the impact of this vulnerability for these products is rated Low.\n            MITIGATION: These are the possible mitigations for this flaw for releases version 1.x:\n\n- Comment out or remove JDBCAppender in the Log4j configuration if it is used\n- Remove the JDBCAppender class from the server's jar files. For example:\n```\nzip -q -d log4j-*.jar org/apache/log4j/jdbc/JDBCAppender.class\n```",
