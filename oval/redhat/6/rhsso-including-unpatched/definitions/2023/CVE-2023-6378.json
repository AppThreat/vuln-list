    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the logback package, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a serialization flaw in the receiver component. By sending specially crafted poisoned data, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition. \n            STATEMENT: The Logback package vulnerability, posing a risk of denial-of-service through a serialization flaw in its receiver component, is considered a moderate issue due to its potential impact on system availability. While denial-of-service vulnerabilities can be disruptive, the severity is tempered by the fact that they generally do not result in unauthorized access or data compromise.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
