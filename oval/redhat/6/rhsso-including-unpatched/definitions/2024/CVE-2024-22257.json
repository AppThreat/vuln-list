    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A broken access control flaw was found in Spring Security. Applications may be vulnerable when directly using the AuthenticatedVoter#vote passing a NULL authentication parameter. \n            STATEMENT: The AuthenticatedVoter class was deprecated since Spring Security 5.8 is used in favor of the AuthorizationManager class, which is not vulnerable to this issue.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
