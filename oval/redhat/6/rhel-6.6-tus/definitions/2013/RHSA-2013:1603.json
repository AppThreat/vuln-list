    "Description": "Luci is a web-based high availability administration application.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the luci service was initialized. If a system\nadministrator started the luci service from a directory that was writable\nto by a local user, that user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code\nas the root or luci user. (CVE-2013-4482)\n\nA flaw was found in the way luci generated its configuration file. The file\nwas created as world readable for a short period of time, allowing a local\nuser to gain access to the authentication secrets stored in the\nconfiguration file. (CVE-2013-4481)\n\nThese issues were discovered by Jan Pokorn√Ω of Red Hat.\n\nThese updated luci packages include numerous bug fixes and two\nenhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this\nadvisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical\nNotes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant\nof these changes.\n\nAll luci users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements. After installing this update, the luci service will be\nrestarted automatically.",
