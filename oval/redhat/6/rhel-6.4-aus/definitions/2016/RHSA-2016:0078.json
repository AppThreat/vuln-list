    "Description": "The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain\nName System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND followed DNS\ndelegations. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted zone\ncontaining a large number of referrals which, when looked up and processed,\nwould cause named to use excessive amounts of memory or crash.\n(CVE-2014-8500)\n\nA flaw was found in the way BIND handled requests for TKEY DNS resource\nrecords. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named (functioning\nas an authoritative DNS server or a DNS resolver) exit unexpectedly with an\nassertion failure via a specially crafted DNS request packet.\n(CVE-2015-5477)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND parsed certain malformed\nDNSSEC keys. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially\ncrafted DNS query (for example, a query requiring a response from a zone\ncontaining a deliberately malformed key) that would cause named functioning\nas a validating resolver to crash. (CVE-2015-5722)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND processed certain\nrecords with malformed class attributes. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to send a query to request a cached record with a malformed class\nattribute that would cause named functioning as an authoritative or\nrecursive server to crash. (CVE-2015-8000)\n\nNote: This issue affects authoritative servers as well as recursive\nservers, however authoritative servers are at limited risk if they perform\nauthentication when making recursive queries to resolve addresses for\nservers listed in NS RRSETs.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting the CVE-2015-5477,\nCVE-2015-5722, and CVE-2015-8000 issues. Upstream acknowledges Jonathan\nFoote as the original reporter of CVE-2015-5477, and Hanno BÃ¶ck as the\noriginal reporter of CVE-2015-5722.\n\nAll bind users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.",
