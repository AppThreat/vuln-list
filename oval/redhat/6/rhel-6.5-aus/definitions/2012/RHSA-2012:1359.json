    "Description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In\naddition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized\nsystems.\n\nA flaw was found in libvirtd's RPC call handling. An attacker able to\nestablish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash\nlibvirtd by sending an RPC message that has an event as the RPC number, or\nan RPC number that falls into a gap in the RPC dispatch table.\n(CVE-2012-4423)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Wenlong Huang of the Red Hat Virtualization QE\nTeam.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When the host_uuid option was present in the libvirtd.conf file, the\naugeas libvirt lens was unable to parse the file. This bug has been fixed\nand the augeas libvirt lens now parses libvirtd.conf as expected in the\ndescribed scenario. (BZ#858988)\n\n* Disk hot plug is a two-part action: the qemuMonitorAddDrive() call is\nfollowed by the qemuMonitorAddDevice() call. When the first part succeeded\nbut the second one failed, libvirt failed to roll back the first part and\nthe device remained in use even though the disk hot plug failed. With this\nupdate, the rollback for the drive addition is properly performed in the\ndescribed scenario and disk hot plug now works as expected. (BZ#859376)\n\n* When a virtual machine was started with an image chain using block\ndevices and a block rebase operation was issued, the operation failed on\ncompletion in the blockJobAbort() function. This update relabels and\nconfigures cgroups for the backing files and the rebase operation now\nsucceeds. (BZ#860720)\n\nAll users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing\nthe updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.",
