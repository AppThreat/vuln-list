    "Description": "Augeas is a utility for editing configuration. Augeas parses configuration\nfiles in their native formats and transforms them into a tree.\nConfiguration changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back\ninto native configuration files. Augeas also uses \"lenses\" as basic\nbuilding blocks for establishing the mapping from files into the Augeas\ntree and back.\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way Augeas handled configuration files\nwhen updating them. An application using Augeas to update configuration\nfiles in a directory that is writable to by a different user (for example,\nan application running as root that is updating files in a directory owned\nby a non-root service user) could have been tricked into overwriting\narbitrary files or leaking information via a symbolic link or mount point\nattack. (CVE-2012-0786, CVE-2012-0787)\n\nThe augeas package has been upgraded to upstream version 1.0.0, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.\n(BZ#817753)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, when single quotes were used in an XML attribute, Augeas was\nunable to parse the file with the XML lens. An upstream patch has been\nprovided ensuring that single quotes are handled as valid characters and\nparsing no longer fails. (BZ#799885)\n\n* Prior to this update, Augeas was unable to set up the \"require_ssl_reuse\"\noption in the vsftpd.conf file. The updated patch fixes the vsftpd lens to\nproperly recognize this option, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#855022)\n\n* Previously, the XML lens did not support non-Unix line endings.\nConsequently, Augeas was unable to load any files containing such line\nendings. The XML lens has been fixed to handle files with CRLF line\nendings, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#799879)\n\n* Previously, Augeas was unable to parse modprobe.conf files with spaces\naround \"=\" characters in option directives. The modprobe lens has been\nupdated and parsing no longer fails. (BZ#826752)\n\nAll Augeas users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements.",
