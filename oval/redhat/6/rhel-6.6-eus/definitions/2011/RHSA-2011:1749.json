    "Description": "The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation\nof various XML standards. One of those standards is the XML Path Language\n(XPath), which is a language for addressing parts of an XML document.\n\nAn off-by-one error, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in\nthe way libxml2 parsed certain XML files. A remote attacker could provide\na specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked\nagainst libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the\napplication. (CVE-2011-0216)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker\nwere able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using\nlibxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against\nthe crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1944)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath\nexpressions. If an attacker were able to supply a specially-crafted XML\nfile to an application using libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for\nthat application to run against the crafted file, it could cause the\napplication to crash. (CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494, CVE-2011-2821,\nCVE-2011-2834)\n\nNote: Red Hat does not ship any applications that use libxml2 in a way that\nwould allow the CVE-2011-1944, CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494, CVE-2011-2821,\nand CVE-2011-2834 flaws to be exploited; however, third-party applications\nmay allow XPath expressions to be passed which could trigger these flaws.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting the\nCVE-2010-4008 issue. Upstream acknowledges Bui Quang Minh from Bkis as the\noriginal reporter of CVE-2010-4008.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* A number of patches have been applied to harden the XPath processing code\nin libxml2, such as fixing memory leaks, rounding errors, XPath numbers\nevaluations, and a potential error in encoding conversion. (BZ#732335)\n\nAll users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. The desktop must\nbe restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.",
