    "Description": "The php-pear package contains the PHP Extension and Application Repository\n(PEAR), a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components.\n\nIt was found that the \"pear\" command created temporary files in an insecure\nway when installing packages. A malicious, local user could use this flaw\nto conduct a symbolic link attack, allowing them to overwrite the contents\nof arbitrary files accessible to the victim running the \"pear install\"\ncommand. (CVE-2011-1072)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The php-pear package has been upgraded to version 1.9.4, which provides a\nnumber of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#651897)\n\n* Prior to this update, php-pear created a cache in the\n\"/var/cache/php-pear/\" directory when attempting to list all packages. As a\nconsequence, php-pear failed to create or update the cache file as a\nregular user without sufficient file permissions and could not list all\npackages. With this update, php-pear no longer fails if writing to the\ncache directory is not permitted. Now, all packages are listed as expected.\n(BZ#747361)\n\nAll users of php-pear are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncorrects these issues.",
