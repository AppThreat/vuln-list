    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in unbound. A reachable assertion in the synth_cname function can be triggered by sending invalid packets to the server. If asserts are disabled during compilation, this issue might lead to an out-of-bounds write in dname_pkt_copy function. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as service availability. \n            STATEMENT: This issue could not be triggered by running unbound regularly, but only by injecting the packet directly to the vulnerable function through fuzzing. For this reason its Impact is Moderate. Upstream has also disputed this CVE.",
