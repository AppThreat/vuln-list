    "Description": "389 Directory Server is an LDAP version 3 (LDAPv3) compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server administration.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that 389 Directory Server was vulnerable to a flaw in which the default ACI (Access Control Instructions) could be read by an anonymous user. This could lead to leakage of sensitive information. (CVE-2016-5416)\n\n* An information disclosure flaw was found in 389 Directory Server. A user with no access to objects in certain LDAP sub-tree could send LDAP ADD operations with a specific object name. The error message returned to the user was different based on whether the target object existed or not. (CVE-2016-4992)\n\n* It was found that 389 Directory Server was vulnerable to a remote password disclosure via timing attack. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve directory server password after many tries. (CVE-2016-5405)\n\nThe CVE-2016-5416 issue was discovered by Viktor Ashirov (Red Hat); the CVE-2016-4992 issue was discovered by Petr Spacek (Red Hat) and Martin Basti (Red Hat); and the CVE-2016-5405 issue was discovered by William Brown (Red Hat).\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, a bug in the changelog iterator buffer caused it to point to an incorrect position when reloading the buffer. This caused replication to skip parts of the changelog, and consequently some changes were not replicated. This bug has been fixed, and replication data loss due to an incorrectly reloaded changelog buffer no longer occurs. (BZ#1354331)\n\n* Previously, if internal modifications were generated on a consumer (for example by the Account Policy plug-in) and additional changes to the same attributes were received from replication, a bug caused Directory Server to accumulate state information on the consumer. The bug has been fixed by making sure that replace operations are only applied if they are newer than existing attribute deletion change sequence numbers (CSNs), and state information no longer accumulates in this situation. (BZ#1379599)\n\nEnhancement(s):\n\n* In a multi-master replication environment where multiple masters receive updates at the same time, it was previously possible for a single master to obtain exclusive access to a replica and hold it for a very long time due to problems such as a slow network connection. During this time, other masters were blocked from accessing the same replica, which considerably slowed down the replication process. This update adds a new configuration attribute, \"nsds5ReplicaReleaseTimeout\", which can be used to specify a timeout in seconds. After the specified timeout period passes, the master releases the replica, allowing other masters to access it and send their updates. (BZ#1358390)",
