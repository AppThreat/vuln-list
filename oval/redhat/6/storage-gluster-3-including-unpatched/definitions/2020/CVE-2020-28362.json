    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the math/big package of Go's standard library that causes a denial of service. Applications written in Go that use math/big via cryptographic packages, including crypto/rsa and crypto/x509, are vulnerable and can potentially cause panic via a crafted certificate chain. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) 1.1 is Out Of Support Scope (OOSS) for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities because it is now in the Maintenance Phase of the support.\nOpenshift Virtualization 1 (formerly Container Native Virtualization) is Out Of Support Scope (OOSS) for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 shipped multi-cloud-object-gateway-cli and noobaa-operator container as a technical preview and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n\nOpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.5 and earlier are built with Go versions earlier than 1.14, which are not affected by this vulnerability. OCP 4.6 is built with Go 1.15 and is affected.",
