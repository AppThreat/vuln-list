    "Description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In\naddition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized\nsystems.\n\nIt was found that libvirtd leaked file descriptors when listing all volumes\nfor a particular pool. A remote attacker able to establish a read-only\nconnection to libvirtd could use this flaw to cause libvirtd to consume all\navailable file descriptors, preventing other users from using libvirtd\nservices (such as starting a new guest) until libvirtd is restarted.\n(CVE-2013-1962)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Edoardo Comar of IBM for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, libvirt made control group (cgroup) requests on files that\nit should not have. With older kernels, such nonsensical cgroup requests\nwere ignored; however, newer kernels are stricter, resulting in libvirt\nlogging spurious warnings and failures to the libvirtd and audit logs. The\naudit log failures displayed by the ausearch tool were similar to the\nfollowing:\n\nroot    [date] - failed     cgroup     allow     path     rw     /dev/kqemu\n\nWith this update, libvirt no longer attempts the nonsensical cgroup\nactions, leaving only valid attempts in the libvirtd and audit logs (making\nit easier to search for real cases of failure). (BZ#958837)\n\n* Previously, libvirt used the wrong variable when constructing audit\nmessages. This led to invalid audit messages, causing ausearch to format\ncertain entries as having \"path=(null)\" instead of the correct path. This\ncould prevent ausearch from locating events related to cgroup device ACL\nmodifications for guests managed by libvirt. With this update, the audit\nmessages are generated correctly, preventing loss of audit coverage.\n(BZ#958839)\n\nAll users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing\nthe updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.",
