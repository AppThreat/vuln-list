    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that vdsm would invoke qemu-img on untrusted inputs without limiting resources. By uploading a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause the qemu-img process to consume unbounded amounts of memory of CPU time, causing a denial of service condition that could potentially impact other users of the host. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3 is now in Extended Life Phase of the support and maintenance lifecycle. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Moderate, and it is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Virtualization 3.
