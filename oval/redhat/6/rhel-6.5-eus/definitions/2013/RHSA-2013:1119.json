    "Description": "The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages\ninclude the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and\ncommand-line utilities for server administration.\n\nIt was discovered that the 389 Directory Server did not honor defined\nattribute access controls when evaluating search filter expressions. A\nremote attacker (with permission to query the Directory Server) could use\nthis flaw to determine the values of restricted attributes via a series of\nsearch queries with filter conditions that used restricted attributes.\n(CVE-2013-2219)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Ludwig Krispenz of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the disk monitoring feature did not function properly. If\nlogging functionality was set to critical and logging was disabled, rotated\nlogs would be deleted. If the attribute \"nsslapd-errorlog-level\" was\nexplicitly set to any value, even zero, the disk monitoring feature would\nnot stop the Directory Server when it was supposed to. This update\ncorrects the disk monitoring feature settings, and it no longer\nmalfunctions in the described scenarios. (BZ#972930)\n\n* Previously, setting the \"nsslapd-disk-monitoring-threshold\" attribute via\nldapmodify to a large value worked as expected; however, a bug in\nldapsearch caused such values for the option to be displayed as negative\nvalues. This update corrects the bug in ldapsearch and correct values are\nnow displayed. (BZ#984970)\n\n* If logging functionality was not set to critical, then the mount point\nfor the logs directory was incorrectly skipped during the disk space check.\n(BZ#987850)\n\nAll 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing\nthis update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically.",
