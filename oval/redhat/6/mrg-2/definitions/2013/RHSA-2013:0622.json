    "Description": "The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A flaw was found in the way file permission checks for the\n\"/dev/cpu/[x]/msr\" files were performed in restricted root environments\n(for example, when using a capability-based security model). A local user\nwith the ability to write to these files could use this flaw to escalate\ntheir privileges to kernel level, for example, by writing to the\nSYSENTER_EIP_MSR register. (CVE-2013-0268, Important)\n\n* A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's ptrace\nimplementation handled PTRACE_SETREGS requests when the debuggee was woken\ndue to a SIGKILL signal instead of being stopped. A local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-0871,\nImportant)\n\n* An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the way SOCK_DIAG_BY_FAMILY\nNetlink messages were processed in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1763,\nImportant)\n\n* It was found that the default SCSI command filter does not accommodate\ncommands that overlap across device classes. A privileged guest user could\npotentially use this flaw to write arbitrary data to a LUN that is\npassed-through as read-only. (CVE-2012-4542, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the __skb_recv_datagram() function in the\nLinux kernel processed payload-less socket buffers (skb) when the MSG_PEEK\noption was requested. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to\ncause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2013-0290, Moderate)\n\nThe CVE-2012-4542 issue was discovered by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* There was high contention on run-queue lock when load balancing before\nidling, causing latency spikes on high CPU core count systems. With this\nupdate, IPI is used to send notification to cores with pending work, and\nthe cores push the work rather than trying to pull it, resolving this\nissue. (BZ#858396)\n\n* Previously, ACPI lock was converted to an rt_mutex, leading to a\ntraceback when scheduling while atomic. With this update, ACPI lock has\nbeen converted back to a raw spinlock. (BZ#909965)\n\n* Fibre Channel (FC)/iSCSI device state was set to off-line and after a\ntimeout, not set back to running. Such a device would not come back online\nafter a fast_io_fail or timeout. With this update, an explicit check for\nthe device being offline has been added, and the device is set back to\nrunning when re-initializing, allowing devices to recover after a failure\nor timeout. (BZ#912942)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.\nThe system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.",
