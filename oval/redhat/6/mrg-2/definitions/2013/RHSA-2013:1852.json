    "Description": "Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation\nIT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased\nperformance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for\nenterprise customers.\n\nMRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to\nachieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure\nutilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high\nperformance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling\npolicy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource\nmanagement. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into\na queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a\npolicy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user\nupon completion.\n\nIt was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected\nfrom HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing\na gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to\nHTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)\n\nIt was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead\nto man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)\n\nIt was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an\nunsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process\na version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial\nof service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)\n\nA flaw was found in the way cumin enforced user roles, allowing an\nunprivileged cumin user to access a range of resources without having the\nappropriate role. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to\naccess privileged information, and perform a variety of privileged\noperations. (CVE-2013-4404)\n\nIt was found that multiple forms in the cumin web interface did not protect\nagainst Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker\ncould trick a user, who is logged into the cumin web interface, into\nvisiting a specially crafted URL, the attacker could perform actions in the\ncontext of the logged in user. (CVE-2013-4405)\n\nIt was found that cumin did not properly escape input from the \"Max\nallowance\" field in the \"Set limit\" form of the cumin web interface.\nA remote attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)\nattacks against victims by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted\nURL. (CVE-2013-4414)\n\nA flaw was found in the way cumin parsed POST request data. A remote\nattacker could potentially use this flaw to perform SQL injection attacks\non cumin's database. (CVE-2013-4461)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting CVE-2013-4287.\nUpstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter of\nCVE-2013-4287. The CVE-2013-4404, CVE-2013-4405, CVE-2013-4414, and\nCVE-2013-4461 issues were discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG\nQuality Engineering team.\n\nAll users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to\nupgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.",
