    "Description": "The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality\nflags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared (that is, a\nprivileged application will not be affected by those flags). It was found\nthat those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged\nvia file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass\nintended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application\nshipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise MRG is made privileged via file\nsystem capabilities. (CVE-2012-2123, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's journal_unmap_buffer()\nfunction handled buffer head states. On systems that have an ext4 file\nsystem with a journal mounted, a local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086, Moderate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The CAP_SYS_ADMIN check was missing from the dmesg_restrict feature.\nConsequently, an unprivileged and jailed root user could bypass the\ndmesg_restrict protection. This update adds CAP_SYS_ADMIN to both\ndmesg_restrict and kptr_restrict, which only allows writing to\ndmesg_restrict when root has CAP_SYS_ADMIN. (BZ#808271)\n\n* Previously, the _copy_from_pages() function, which is used to copy data \nfrom the temporary buffer to the user-passed buffer, was passed the wrong \nsize parameter when copying data. Consequently, if the user provided a \nbuffer greater than PAGE_SIZE, the getxattr() syscalls were handled \nincorrectly. This update fixes _copy_from_pages() to use the ACL length, \nwhich uses a correctly-sized buffer. (BZ#753230)\n\n* Some older versions of hardware or their software could not recognize\ncertain commands and would log messages for illegal or unsupported errors\nthe driver could not properly handle. This bug has been fixed and no bogus\nerror messages are now returned in the described scenario. (BZ#813892)\n\n* Previously, the qla2x00_poll() function did the local_irq_save() call\nbefore calling qla24xx_intr_handler(), which had a spinlock. Since\nspinlocks are sleepable in the real-time kernel, it is not allowed to call\nthem with interrupts disabled. This scenario produced error messages and\ncould cause a system deadlock. With this update, the\nlocal_irq_save_nort(flags) function is used to save flags without disabling\ninterrupts, which prevents potential deadlocks and removes the error\nmessages. (BZ#818220)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.\nThe system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.",
