    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Git-python. By injecting a malicious URL into the clone command, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability as the library makes external calls to git without any input sanitization. This issue leads to complete system compromise. \n            STATEMENT: Across all supported releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform the usage of a compromised GitPython API (clone_from()) is quite limited. The only people capable of exploiting this vulnerability are system administrators. For this reason, the impact has been downgraded to medium.\n\nThe impact to Red Hat OpenStack Platform 17 is rated Low as the compromised function is not in use.",
