    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An improper input validation vulnerability was found in GitPython. This flaw allows an attacker to inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command, possibly leading to remote code execution. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Openstack, Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, and Red Hat Certification Program, while the gitpython dependency is present, the affected codebase is not being used. \n\nRed Hat Satellite does not use the affected functions during runtime, therefore the possible impact is limited to Moderate.",
