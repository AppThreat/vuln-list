    "Description": "Flask is called a “micro-framework” because the idea to keep the core\nsimple but extensible. There is no database abstraction layer, no form\nvalidation or anything else where different libraries already exist that\ncan handle that. However Flask knows the concept of extensions that can add\nthis functionality into your application as if it was implemented in Flask\nitself. There are currently extensions for object relational mappers, form\nvalidation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and\nmore.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary:\nCookie header (CVE-2023-30861)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\npage listed in the References section.",
