    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the ceph-ansible playbook where it contained hardcoded passwords that were being used as default passwords while deploying Ceph services. Any authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw to brute-force Ceph deployments, and gain administrator access to Ceph clusters via the Ceph dashboard to initiate read, write, and delete Ceph clusters and also modify Ceph cluster configurations. \n            STATEMENT: The version of ceph-ansible included in Red Hat OpenStack 15 was temporary, OpenStack 15 installations will consume updates to this package from Ceph channels.\n            MITIGATION: Change and use strong passwords in ceph-ansible playbook\n\n- https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/blob/v4.0.14/roles/ceph-defaults/defaults/main.yml#L701\n- https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/blob/v4.0.14/roles/ceph-defaults/defaults/main.yml#L711",
