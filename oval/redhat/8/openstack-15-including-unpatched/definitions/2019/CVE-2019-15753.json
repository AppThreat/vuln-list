    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In OpenStack os-vif 1.15.x before 1.15.2, and 1.16.0, a hard-coded MAC aging time of 0 disables MAC learning in linuxbridge, forcing obligatory Ethernet flooding of non-local destinations, which both impedes network performance and allows users to possibly view the content of packets for instances belonging to other tenants sharing the same network. Only deployments using the linuxbridge backend are affected. This occurs in PyRoute2.add() in internal/command/ip/linux/impl_pyroute2.py. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10, 13, \u0026 14:\nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. The vulnerable code is not present in the python-os-vif packages provided, therefore these releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform are unaffected.",
