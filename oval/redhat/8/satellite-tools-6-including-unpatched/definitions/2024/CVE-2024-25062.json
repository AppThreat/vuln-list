    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A use-after-free flaw was found in libxml2. When using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation and XInclude expansion enabled, processing crafted XML documents can lead to an xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free. \n            STATEMENT: The use-after-free vulnerability identified in libxml2 presents a Moderate severity issue due to its potential for exploitation under specific conditions. While the flaw requires the presence of crafted XML documents and the utilization of features such as DTD validation and XInclude expansion, its impact is limited by these prerequisites. However, in scenarios where these conditions are met, an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause application crashes, thereby posing a moderate risk to affected systems.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
