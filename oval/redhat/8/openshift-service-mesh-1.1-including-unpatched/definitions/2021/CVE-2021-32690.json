    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was discovered in Helm, which could allow credentials associated with one Helm repository to be leaked to another repository referenced by the first one.  In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to control a repository trusted by the configuration of the target Helm instance. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes:\n\nIn Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) the affected components are using helm chart provided by the installer, so components are not using untrusted charts except in the application-lifecycle area. For this reason we marked the impact as low. For RHACM, the credentials could be leaked only when a helm chart is stored in a domain other than the helm repository itself. In practice, this rarely happens as the chart is stored in the same helm repository. For example, this chart in the helm repo https://charts.helm.sh/stable/index.yaml references only charts stored in the same domain (charts.heml.sh). From version, 2.2 onwards, multicloud-operators-placementrule and multicloud-operators-deployable do not use helm at all.\n\nOpenShift Developer Tools and Services:\n\nThe OpenShift Helm team has analyzed this CVE and we have come to the conclusion that this only affects OpenShift Helm customers that use the CLI to install and update charts. It does not affect customers that use the OpenShift Console to install and update charts. To mitigate this issue, customers can refresh their Helm cli by following the Red Had official Helm install guide here: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/helm_cli/getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift-container-platform.html#installing-helm_getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift. The mirror (https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/helm/latest/) have already been updated with helm 3.6.2 which contains the fix for this CVE.",
