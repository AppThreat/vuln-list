    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in luajit. An out-of-bounds read can occur due to a frame traversal being mishandled.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift ServiceMesh proxy does package a vulnerable version of luajit. The segmentation fault is triggered via creating a inline code rule in the envoy filter, however envoy can also be caused to exit via a code rule which is also not syntactically correct either. A user who has permissions to change the filter rule can have the same affect regardless, hence this issue will not be addressed at this time and might be fixed in a future release.",
