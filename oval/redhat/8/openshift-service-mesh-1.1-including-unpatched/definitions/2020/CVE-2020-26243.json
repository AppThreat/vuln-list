    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found nanopd. If dynamic allocation is enabled and the oneof field contains a static sub-message, an attacker can use this flaw to leak memory potentially resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) packages a vulnerable version of nanopb in the RPM servicemesh-proxy, however it does not define PB_ENABLE_MALLOC and hence the code in pb_release_union_field is never reached. As such, OSSM is deemed to be of Moderate impact and marked wontfix at this time although it may be fixed in a future update.",
