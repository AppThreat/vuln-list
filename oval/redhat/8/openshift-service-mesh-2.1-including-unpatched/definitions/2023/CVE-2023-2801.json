    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in grafana. This issue occurs when sending an API call to the /ds/query or public dashboard query endpoint that has mixed queries, such as having two or more distinct data sources in one API call. As a result, the Grafana instance will crash. Currently, the only feature that uses mixed queries within Grafana is public dashboards, but it is also possible to trigger this issue by calling the API directly.\nIf public dashboards are enabled, reproduction requires a public dashboard to be under a heavy load. If public dashboards are disabled, reproduction only occurs when the /ds/query endpoint with a mixed query payload is under a heavy load with a load testing script. \n            STATEMENT: - In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM), and OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) the grafana components are protected by OpenShift OAuth that reduces the impact of this flaw to Moderate.\n-  OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) has switched to using upstream rhel rpms for grafana and is no longer maintaining the servicemesh-grafana package. Hence, it is marked as affected/won'tfix.\n            MITIGATION: Block mixed query requests and patch to disable mixed query concurrent calls",
