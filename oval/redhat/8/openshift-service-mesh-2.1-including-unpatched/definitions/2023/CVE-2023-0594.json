    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the grafana package. This flaw allows a malicious user with the ability to introduce trace data to provide a JavaScript that changes the password for the user viewing the trace view (this could be an admin) to a known password, thus gaining access to the admin account. \n            STATEMENT: This is an issue with Grafana Tempo which we don't ship in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Hence, RHEL-8, 9 are not-affected.\n            MITIGATION: Applying the Content-Security-Policy shipped with Grafana would block inline scripts from executing and would mitigate this.",
