    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the express.js npm package of nodejs:14 module stream. Express.js Express is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a prototype pollution flaw in qs. By adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype using a __proto__ or constructor payload, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: - The qs and express Package is not used by the OpenShift Container Platform console directly and is only a third-party package dependency. Hence, it is marked as wontfix. \nAs a result, any services that depend on Openshift for their use of qs and express are marked won't fix. \n- In OpenShift Service Mesh, 'qs' is hoisted from storybook and node-sass, both are dev dependencies, and the vulnerability is not exposed to end users. Hence marked as wontfix.",
