    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A stack overflow flaw was found in Golang's regexp module, which can crash the runtime if the application using regexp accepts very long or arbitrarily long regexps from untrusted sources that have sufficient nesting depths. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send large regexps with deep nesting to the application. Triggering this flaw leads to a crash of the runtime, which causes a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as a Moderate impact flaw because the exploitation of this flaw requires that an affected application accept arbitrarily long regexps from untrusted sources, which has inherent risks (even without this flaw), especially involving impacts to application availability.",
