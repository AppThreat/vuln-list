    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in archive/zip of the Go standard library. Applications written in Go where Reader.Open (the API implementing io/fs.FS introduced in Go 1.16) can panic when parsing a crafted ZIP archive containing completely invalid names or an empty filename argument. \n            STATEMENT: * In OpenShift Container Platform multiple components are written in Go and use archive/zip from the standard library. However, all such components are short lived client side tools, not long lived server side executables. As the maximum impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service in client utilities, this vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Platform.\n\n* Because Service Telemetry Framework1.2 will be retiring soon and the flaw's impact is lower, no update will be provided at this time for STF1.2's sg-core-container.\n\n* Because Red Hat Ceph Storage only uses Go's archive/zip for the Grafana CLI and thus is not directly exploitable, the vulnerability has been rated low for Red Hat Ceph Storage.",
