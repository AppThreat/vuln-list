    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Java logging library Apache Log4j in version 1.x. JMSSink in Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data. This allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if JMSSink is deployed and has been configured to perform JNDI requests. \n            STATEMENT: Note this flaw ONLY affects applications which are specifically configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default, or when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration for adding JMSSink to the attacker's JNDI LDAP endpoint.\n\nRed Hat Satellite bundles log4j-over-slf4j with Candlepin, however, product is not affected as it uses logback framework for logging.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization and OpenShift Container Platform in the OCP Metering stack (the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components) ship a vulnerable version of the log4j package, however JMSSink is not used. Therefore the impact of this vulnerability for these products is rated Low.\n            MITIGATION: These are the possible mitigations for this flaw for releases version 1.x:\n\n- Comment out or remove JMSSink in the Log4j configuration if it is used\n- Remove the JMSSink class from the server's jar files. For example:\n```\nzip -q -d log4j-*.jar org/apache/log4j/net/JMSSink.class\n```\n- Restrict access for the OS user on the platform running the application to prevent modifying the Log4j configuration by the attacker.",
