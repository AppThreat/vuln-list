    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the log4j 1.x chainsaw component, where the contents of certain log entries are deserialized and possibly permit code execution. This flaw allows an attacker to send a malicious request with serialized data to the server to be deserialized when the chainsaw component is run. \n            STATEMENT: Chainsaw is a standalone graphical user interface for viewing log entries in log4j. This flaw may be bypassed by using other available means to access log entries.\n\nRed Hat Satellite bundles log4j-over-slf4j with Candlepin, however, product is not affected as it uses logback framework for logging.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization ships a vulnerable version of the log4j package, however chainsaw is not part of typical use cases. An attacker looking to exploit this would need to not only be able to generate a malicious log entry, but also have the necessary access and permissions to start chainsaw on the engine node. Therefore the impact of this vulnerability for Red Hat Virtualization is rated Low.\n\nSimilar to Red Hat Virtualization in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of log4j package, however vulnerable chainsaw component is not used by default. Therefore the impact to OCP is reduced to Low.\n            MITIGATION: These are the mitigations available for this flaw for log4j 1.x:\n- Avoid using Chainsaw to view logs, and instead use some other utility, especially if there is a log view available within the product itself.\n- Remove the Chainsaw classes from the log4j jar files. For example:\n```\nzip -q -d log4j-*.jar org/apache/log4j/chainsaw/*\n```\n(log4j jars may be nested in zip archives within product)",
