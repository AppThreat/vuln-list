    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s L2CAP bluetooth functionality in how a user generates malicious L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets. This flaw allows a local or bluetooth connection user to crash the system. \n            STATEMENT: This issue is rated Moderate based on the known scenarios of attack that cause a denial of service.\n            MITIGATION: To mitigate these vulnerabilities on the operating system level, disable the Bluetooth functionality via blocklisting kernel modules in the Linux kernel. The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. Instructions on how to disable Bluetooth modules are available on the customer portal at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931.\n\nAlternatively, bluetooth can be disabled within the hardware or at the BIOS level, which will also provide effective mitigation as the kernel will not detect Bluetooth hardware on the system.",
