    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Commons Text packages 1.5 through 1.9.  The affected versions allow an attacker to benefit from a variable interpolation process contained in Apache Commons Text, which can cause properties to be dynamically defined. Server applications are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) and unintentional contact with untrusted remote servers. \n            STATEMENT: In order to carry a successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the following steps should be in place in the affected target:\n  - Usage of specific methods that interpolate the variables as described in the flaw\n  - Usage of external input for those methods\n  - Usage of that external input has to be unsanitized/no \"allow list\"/etc.\n\nThe following products have *Low* impact because they have maven references to the affected package but does not ship it nor use the code:\n- Red Hat EAP Expansion Pack (EAP-XP)\n- Red Hat Camel-K\n- Red Hat Camel-Quarkus\n\nRed Hat Satellite ships Candlepin that embeds Apache Commons Text, however, it is not vulnerable to the flaw since library has not been exposed in the product code. In Candlepin, the Commons Text is being pulled for the Liquibase and ActiveMQ Artemis libraries as a dependency. Red Hat Product Security has evaluated and rated the impact of the flaw as Low for Satellite since there was no harm identified to confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems.\n\nOpenShift 3.11 is already in the ELS support model phase. The Jenkins components are out of scope of the ELS support, hence OpenShift 3.11 Jenkins component is marked in this CVE as \"Will not fix.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw may be avoided by ensuring that any external inputs used with the Commons-Text lookup methods are sanitized properly. Untrusted input should always be thoroughly sanitized before using in any potentially risky situations.",
