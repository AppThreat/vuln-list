    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_macro module of httpd. When processing a very long macro, the null byte terminator will not be added, leading to an out-of-bounds read, resulting in a crash. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw only affects configurations with mod_macro loaded when a very long macro is configured and used, specifically a macro longer than 8191 characters. If these conditions are not present, the server is not affected and no further mitigation is needed. For more information about the mitigation, see the mitigation section below.\n\nThe httpd mod_macro module is enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 9, and in RHSCL. However, there are no macros used in the default httpd configuration.\n            MITIGATION: Disabling mod_macro and restarting httpd or making sure the macros used are smaller than the required character amount to trigger this vulnerability will mitigate this flaw. Furthermore, it's unlikely that a very long macro with length needed to trigger this issue is being used.",
