    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: When reading a specially crafted TAR archive an Apache Ant build can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error, even for small inputs. This can be used to disrupt builds using Apache Ant. Apache Ant prior to 1.9.16 and 1.10.11 were affected. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform 4 (OCP) ships affected version of Apache Ant in the ose-metering-hive container, however the metering operator is deprecated since 4.6[1]. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates and hence ose-metering-hive container has been marked as 'will not fix'.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/metering/metering-about-metering.html",
