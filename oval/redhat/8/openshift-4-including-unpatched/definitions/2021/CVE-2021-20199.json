    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in podman. Rootless containers receive all traffic with a source IP address of 127.0.0.1 (including from remote hosts) which impact containerized applications that trust localhost (127.0.01) connections by default and do not require authentication. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect Podman prior to version 1.8.0. Podman shipped in the following products are therefore not affected:\n\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Container Tools stream 1.0\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Container Tools stream 2.0\n* OpenShift Container Platform 3.11\n* OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 to 4.5\n            MITIGATION: Configure containerized applications to require authentication for connections from all sources, including localhost.",
