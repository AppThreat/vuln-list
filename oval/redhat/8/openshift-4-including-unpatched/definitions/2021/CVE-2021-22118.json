    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the jenkins package bundles the vulnerable version of spring-framework, but as Jenkins is not a type of WebFlux application is not impacted by this vulnerability. Therefore the OCP components have been marked as affected/wontfix. This may be fixed in a future release.",
