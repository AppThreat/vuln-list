    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the etcd package. Affected versions of etcd allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via the PageWriter.write function in pagewriter.go, possibly affecting system availability. \n            STATEMENT: The only way to trigger this CVE is to dynamically change an unexported variable's value at runtime, which is not possible in any of the Red Hat products. Although the affected code is present in the codebase, we have rated this as a Moderate impact.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
