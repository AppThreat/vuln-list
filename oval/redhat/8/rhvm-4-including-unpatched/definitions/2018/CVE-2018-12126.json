    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the processor to hand-off address generation logic into these sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations write to a shared distributed processor structure called the 'processor store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor store buffer. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue. Updates will be released as they become available. For additional information, please refer to the 'Vulnerability Response' URL.",
