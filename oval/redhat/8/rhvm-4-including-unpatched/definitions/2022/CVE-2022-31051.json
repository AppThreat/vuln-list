    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in semantic-release. Secrets that are normally masked are accidentally disclosed if they contain characters excluded from uri encoding by `encodeURI()`. The vulnerability is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the related repository is unavailable without modifying the repository URL to inject credentials. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Users should ensure that secrets that do not contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL that is already masked properly.",
