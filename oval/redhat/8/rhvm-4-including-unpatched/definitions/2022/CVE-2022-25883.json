    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in node-semver package via the 'new Range' function. This issue could allow an attacker to pass untrusted malicious regex user data as a range, causing the service to excessively consume CPU depending upon the input size, resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes-2 and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security-3 has been marked as Low severity because node-semver is a Dev dependency for those, used only during the build process, and not used in customer environments.\n\nIn Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) the server-regexp dependency is protected by OAuth what is reducing impact by this flaw to Low.",
