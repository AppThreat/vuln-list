    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw was found in the libuv package due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result, attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites that allow users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. \n            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-24806 vulnerability in libuv, can be classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including the use of hostnames exceeding 256 characters, limiting its applicability. Additionally, the vulnerability primarily exposes servers to SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to internal APIs, rather than facilitating direct system compromise or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the exploit's detection and exploitation require a degree of sophistication, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. While the potential impact on systems leveraging libuv is notable, prudent security measures, such as network controls and vigilant monitoring, can effectively mitigate the risk, thus warranting a moderate severity classification.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
