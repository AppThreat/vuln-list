    "Description": "Werkzeug started as simple collection of various\nutilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced\nWSGI utility modules. It includes a powerful debugger, full featured\nrequest and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache\ncontrol headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL\nrouting system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules. Werkzeug\nis unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template engine, database\nadapter or anything else. It doesn't even enforce a specific way of\nhandling requests and leaves all that up to the developer. It's most useful\nfor end user applications which should work on as many server environments\nas possible (such as blogs, wikis, bulletin boards, etc.).\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* high resource usage when parsing multipart form data with many fields\n(CVE-2023-25577)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\npage listed in the References section.",
