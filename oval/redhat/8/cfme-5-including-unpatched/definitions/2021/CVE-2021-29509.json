    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-puma. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms 5.0 (CFME 5.11) is in the maintenance support phase and we are no longer fixing Medium/Low severity security bugs.
