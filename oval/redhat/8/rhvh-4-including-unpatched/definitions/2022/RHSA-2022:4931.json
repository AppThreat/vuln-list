The appliance is available to download as an OVA file from the Customer Portal.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* postgresql: memory disclosure in certain queries (CVE-2021-3677)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* RHV-M Appliance rebased on RHEL 8.6 (BZ#1997073)\n\n* Previously, a self-hosted engine deployment failed when an OpenSCAP security profile was applied, resulting in the SSH key permissions being changed to 0640. In this release, the permissions are not changed and the deployment succeeds. (BZ#2011309)\n\n* rng-tools, rsyslog-gnutls, usbguard packages added to the RHV-M Appliance to comply with DISA-STIG profile requirements (BZ#2070963)\n\n* OVA package manifest added to the RHV-M Appliance RPM. (BZ#2070980)\n\n* Previously, the nodejs package was downgraded during the RHV-M installation.\nIn this release, the correct version of the nodejs package is installed and maintained. (BZ#2075852)\n\n* RHV-M Appliance rebased on Ceph 4.3 (BZ#2090137)",
