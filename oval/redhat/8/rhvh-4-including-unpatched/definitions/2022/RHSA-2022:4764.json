    "Description": "The ovirt-host package consolidates host package requirements into a single meta package.\n\nSecurity Fix(es) from Bugzilla:\n\n* vdsm: disclosure of sensitive values in log files (CVE-2022-0207)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es) from Bugzilla:\n\n* With this release, RHV 4.4 SP1 has been upgraded to use ansible-core in cockpit-ovirt. (BZ#2066042)\n\n* Rebase package(s) to version: 0.16.0\n\nHighlights and notable enhancements:  https://github.com/oVirt/cockpit-ovirt/releases/tag/cockpit-ovirt-0.16.0 (BZ#2067078)\n\n* Rebase package(s) to version: 0.6.2 (BZ#2060889)\n\n* Rebase package(s) to version: 4.5.0\n\nHighlights, important fixes, or notable enhancements: (BZ#2054733)\n\n* Feature: Include the package nvme-cli on virtualization hosts\n\nReason: The package is requested in RHEL 8 Managing Storage devices, Chapter 15. NVMe over fabrics using FC for accessing that hardware\n\nResult: the needed package is available on the host. (BZ#2058177)\n\n* Previously, the ovirt-ha-broker service failed to start on a host with a DISA STIG profile.\nIn this release, the ovirt-ha-broker binaries were moved to /usr/libexec. As a result, the ovirt-ha-broker service succeeds to start on a host with a DISA STIG profile. (BZ#2050108)\n\n* Previously, during self-hosted engine deployment, the tpgt value was not used in the iSCSI login, creating duplicate iSCSI sessions.\nIN this release, the tpgt value is used in the iSCSI login, and no duplicate iSCSI sessions are created. (BZ#1768969)\n\n* With this release, the self-hosted engine installation supports selecting either DISA STIG or PCI-DSS security profiles for the self-hosted engine VM. (BZ#2029830)\n\n* Red Hat Virtualization 4.4 SP1 now requires ansible-core \u003e= 2.12.0 to execute Ansible playbooks/roles internally from RHV components. (BZ#2052686)\n\n* Rebase package(s) to version: 2.6.1\n\nHighlights, important fixes, or notable enhancements: (BZ#2050512)\n\n* RHV Hypervisor 4.4 SP1, with exception to RHV-H, is able to run on a host with RHEL 8.6 DISA STIG openscap profile applied. (BZ#2015802)\n\n* Previously, SCSI reservation was not set for disks that are hot-plugged.\nIn this release, the SCSI reservation works for disks that are being hot-plugged. (BZ#2028481)\n\n* The Red Hat Virtualization Host is now capable of running on a machine with the PCI-DSS security profile. (BZ#2030226)\n\n* Previously, if storage problems occurred and disappeared during a VM migration attempt, it sometimes led to the VM being paused and not resuming even if the VM had an auto-resume policy set. \nIn this release, the VM is handled according to its resume behavior policy when the storage state changes during a VM migration attempt. (BZ#2010478)\n\n* Previously, the VDSM used UDEV links to create the LVM filter. As a result, the LVM sometimes grabbed SCSI devices during the boot process by mistake.\nIn this release, the  LVM does not not try to grab SCSI devices during the boot process, only using the multipath device specified in the LVM filter.
