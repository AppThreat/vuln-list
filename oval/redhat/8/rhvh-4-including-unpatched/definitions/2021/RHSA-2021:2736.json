    "Description": "The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* kernel: size_t-to-int conversion vulnerability in the filesystem layer (CVE-2021-33909)\n\n* systemd: uncontrolled allocation on the stack in function unit_name_path_escape leads to crash (CVE-2021-33910)\n\n* kernel: use-after-free in net/bluetooth/hci_event.c when destroying an hci_chan (CVE-2021-33034)\n\n* ansible: multiple modules expose secured values (CVE-2021-3447)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* The redhat-release-virtualization-host package no longer requires vdsm-hooks. In this release, the installation of vdsm-hooks is not mandatory for the Red Hat Virtualization Host. (BZ#1976095)\n\n* Previously, rhsmcertd was not enabled by default on the Red Hat Virtualization Host. As a result, the systems did not regularly report to RHSM while the subscription-manager reported no obvious issues and repositories were properly enabled.\nIn this release, rhsmcertd is enabled by default in RHVH, and as a result, RHSM now receives reports regularly. (BZ#1958145)\n\n* In this release, the Red Hat Virtualization Host has been rebased on top of the RHEL 8.4.0 Batch #1 update. For more information, see the RHEL release notes. (BZ#1957242)\n\n* Red Hat Virtualization Host now includes an updated scap-security-guide-rhv which allows you to apply a PCI DSS security profile to the system during installation, (BZ#1883793)",
