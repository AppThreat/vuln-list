    "Description": "The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* python-cryptography: bleichenbacher timing oracle attack against RSA decryption (CVE-2020-25659)\n\n* krb5: unbounded recursion via an ASN.1-encoded Kerberos message in lib/krb5/asn.1/asn1_encode.c may lead to DoS (CVE-2020-28196)\n\n* python-cryptography: certain sequences of update() calls when symmetrically encrypting very large payloads could result in an integer overflow and lead to buffer overflows (CVE-2020-36242)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, old RPM files were not properly removed during package removal (uninistall) or upgrade. As a result, removed packages were reinstalled, or, during and upgrade, the system tried to install two or more different versions at once, causing the upgrade to fail.\nIn this release, the dnf plugin has been fixed, and RPM packages are now properly removed.\nThe new version will also auto-heal the broken system by removing RPM packages which are not supposed to be in the persisted-rpms directory. (BZ#1936972)\n\n* With this release, ovirt-hosted-engine-ha supports multiple, comma-separated values for all iSCSI configuration items. (BZ#1909888)",
