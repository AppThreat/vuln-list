    "Description": "The ovirt-engine package provides the Red Hat Virtualization Manager, a centralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.\n\nThe ovirt.ovirt package (previously ovirt-ansible-collection) manages all oVirt Ansible modules.\n\nThe ovirt-ansible-hosted-engine-setup package provides an Ansible role for deploying Red Hat Virtualization Hosted-Engine.\n\notopi is a standalone, plug-in based installation framework to be used to set up system components. The plug-in nature provides simplicity to add new installation functionality without the complexity of the state and transaction management.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Ansible: ansible-connection module discloses sensitive info in traceback error message (CVE-2021-3620)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\n Bug Fix(es):\n\n* A playbook executed by Ansible Engine 2.9.25 inside a virtual machine running on Red Hat Virtualization 4.4.9 correctly detects that this is a virtual machine running on Red Hat Virtualization by using Ansible facts. (BZ#1904085)\n\n* Red Hat Virtualization now supports Ansible-2.9.27 for internal usage. (BZ#2003671)\n\n* Previously, upgrading from Red Hat Virtualization 4.3 failed when using an isolated network during IPv6 deployment. In this release, a forward network is used instead of an isolated network during an IPv6 deployment. As a result, upgrade from Red Hat Virtualization 4.3 using IPv6 now succeeds. (BZ#1947709)",
