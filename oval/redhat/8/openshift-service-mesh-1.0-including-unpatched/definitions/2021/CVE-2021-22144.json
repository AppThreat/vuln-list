    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Elasticsearch. An uncontrolled recursion vulnerability that could lead to a denial of service attack was identified in the Elasticsearch Grok parser. This flaw allows a user who can submit arbitrary queries to Elasticsearch to create a malicious Grok query that crashes the Elasticsearch node. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) includes an affected version of Elasticsearch in logging-elasticsearch containers. However, Grok is not bundled by Red Hat in the shipped version of Elasticsearch and hence OCP is not affected by this vulnerability.",
