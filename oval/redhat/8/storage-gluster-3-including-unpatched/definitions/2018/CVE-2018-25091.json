    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the urllib3 package. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to information exposure through sent data when the authorization HTTP header is not removed during a cross-origin redirect. An attacker can expose credentials in the authorization header to unintended hosts or transmit them in clear text by exploiting the incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060. \n            STATEMENT: This is only exploitable if a redirect differs in host, port, or scheme. Due to the credential exposure in the authorization header, the confidentiality is highly impacted, but there is no proof that the integrity is affected in any way.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
