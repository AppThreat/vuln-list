    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Golang Go, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by an issue during multipart form parsing. By sending a specially crafted input, a remote attacker can consume large amounts of CPU and memory, resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: For Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n* Conmon uses Go in unit testing, but not functionally in the package. Go is used only in test files, hence, not in the actual code, thus, conmon is not-affected.\n* The CVE refers to multipart form parsing routine mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, which is not used in Grafana, hence it is not-affected.\n* Butane does not parse multipart forms, hence, it is also not-affected.",
