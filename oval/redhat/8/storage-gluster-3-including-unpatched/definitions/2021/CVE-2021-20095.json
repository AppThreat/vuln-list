    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-babel. A path traversal vulnerability was found in how locale data files are checked and loaded within python-babel, allowing a local attacker to trick an application that uses python-babel to load a file outside of the intended locale directory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as service availability. \n            STATEMENT: It is rather uncommon for applications to use Babel.Locale() with an untrusted attacker-controlled language argument. A static language abbreviation string (e.g. \"en\") is most commonly used instead. For this reason, this flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate.",
