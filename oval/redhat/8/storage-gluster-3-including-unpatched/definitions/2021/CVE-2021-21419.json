    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in eventlet. If an unauthenticated user manages to send large websocket frames or highly compressed data frames that can lead to memory exhaustion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (DoS). \n            STATEMENT: * In OpenShift Container Platform 4, the python-eventlet package is only used in Ironic container images, used for Baremetal provisioning, and Kuryr SDN container images, used for deployments on OpenStack.\n\n* In Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, python-eventlet package was primarily shipped as a dependency of openstack-swift. However, Openstack Swift is no longer supported with the recent release of Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.5.\n\n* Because the flaw's impact is lower and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 will be retiring soon, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP13 python-eventlet package.",
