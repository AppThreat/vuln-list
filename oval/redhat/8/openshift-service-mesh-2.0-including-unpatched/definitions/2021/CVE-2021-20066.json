    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jsdom. JSDom improperly allows the loading of local resources, which allows for local files to be manipulated by a malicious web page when script execution is enabled. \n            STATEMENT: For an application which includes jsdom to be vulnerable to this CVE, it must at least enable the loading of resources using something similar to: `new JSDOM(html, {resources: \"usable\"}`, where `html` is un-trusted input. Furthermore, scripts can be executed by extending the options similar to: `new JSDOM(html, {resources: \"usable\", runScripts: \"dangerously\"}`. [1]\n\nOpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) both include components that package a vulnerable version of `jsdom`. However, none of the components directly enable the loading of resources via `resources: \"usable\"` and most components only include `jsdom` for use in tests. Hence for OCP and OSSM the affects are rated to have a Low impact and are wontfix at this time and might be fixed in a future release.\n\n[1] https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#loading-subresources",
