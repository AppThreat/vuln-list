    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in is-svg package. A malicious string provided by an attacker may lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).\nThe highest threat from this vulnerability is to availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) 4 delivers the kibana package where the nodejs-is-svg package is bundled, but during the update to container first (to openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6 since OCP 4.5) the dependency was removed and hence kibana package is marked as wontfix. This may be fixed in the future.\n\nIn OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth. This restricts access to the vulnerable nodejs-is-svg to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is low.\n\nRed Hat Quay includes is-svg as a dependency of css-loader which is only using during development, not runtime. This issues has been rated low impact for Red Hat Quay.",
