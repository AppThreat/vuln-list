    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A verification flaw was found in python-pysaml2, where it did not check that the signature in a SAML document was enveloped, which enabled XML signature wrapping (XSW) attacks.  A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to convince SAML processing to verify the signature and accept malicious data.  This issue specifically affects the verification of signed SAML assertions. \n            STATEMENT: All versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform ship but do not use the flawed check-signature functionality of python-pysaml2. The impact for these products is therefore rated as having a security impact of Low and no update will be provided at this time for the impacted RHOSP packages.\n            MITIGATION: There is no known mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.",
