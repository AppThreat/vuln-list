    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: An issue was discovered in HDF5 through 1.12.0. A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the function Decompress() located in decompress.c. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to the gif2h5 binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service. \n            STATEMENT: HDF5 is included as part of a loose dependency trail from python3-hardware package. There is a very low likelihood that an attacker would be able to exploit this vulnerability in a meaningful way in both OpenShift and OpenStack\n\nIn OpenShift 4.3, hdf5 is included in the container openshift/ironic-hardware-inventory-recorder-image, the dependency tail is: python3-hardware -\u003e python3-pandas -\u003e python3-tables -\u003e hdf5",
