    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the regex used to process HTTP Headers in python-waitress and is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server to cause a denial of service attack. \n            STATEMENT: * OpenShift Container Platform 4 uses an earlier version of python-waitress which is not affected by this vulnerability.\n* Red Hat Quay uses an earlier version of python-waitress which is not affected by this vulnerability.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 15 and 16 ship but do not use the flawed version of python-waitress. The impact for these products is therefore rated as having a security impact of Low. (Earlier versions of RHOSP do not ship the flawed code.)\n* This issue did not affect Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4 as the vulnerable code is not present in the shipped version of python-waitress.",
