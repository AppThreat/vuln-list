    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in etcd. The gateway TLS authentication is only applied to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records. When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable etcd to authenticated users only, therefore the impact by this vulnerability is Low.\nA similar access restriction is in place in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) as etcd is limited to use within the internal API network, which is not accessible to any OpenStack tenants. Additionally, RHOSP does not use the etcd gateway.",
